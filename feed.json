				"content_html": "<p>I recently listened to a podcast episode of The Headliners with Nihal Arthanayaka in which he interviewed Gary Stevenson. I‚Äôd never heard of Gary Stevenson before moving to the UK. Gary had a lot to say about wealth inequality, which was interesting, but I was left with a lot of questions. I know this isn&rsquo;t BBC Radio 4, but I would have thought at least Nihal would ask a few probing questions and challenge him on some of the details. No. It was a really poor interview.</p>\n<p>It got me interested though.

No skim-reading. I read the full book in one day (I got nothing else done that day).</p>\n<p>I couldn&rsquo;t put it down. It&rsquo;s an incredible insight into that life. Think Wall Street or The Big Short but relocated to London. More than that, when he becomes disillusioned and decides to leave, it&rsquo;s more like a thriller.

When he talks about how the 2008 financial crisis and COVID exacerbated the shift of assets from the middle class to the ultra wealthy, I get it.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a few books on economics lately - trying to get my head around some of the basic economic theory. Gary is inspired by economists such as Thomas Piketty, who popularised the &ldquo;r &gt; g&rdquo; argument in his book <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18736925-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century\">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a></em>.</p>\n<p>The ‚Äúr &gt; g‚Äù argument refers to the idea that when the rate of return on capital (r) exceeds the rate of economic growth (g), wealth tends to concentrate over time. In other words, if the income generated by investments (like dividends, rents, interest, and capital gains) grows faster than the overall economy and wages, those who already hold capital (typically the wealthy) will see their wealth grow disproportionately. This dynamic can lead to rising inequality unless offset by policies like progressive taxation, especially on capital and wealth.</p>\n<p>Gary&rsquo;s solution, in general, is to place a 1% tax on unrealised gains from those worth more than ¬£10 million. After that, he&rsquo;s a bit hazy on the specifics. This is where the main problem lies.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm really interested, but I need to hear the counter-arguments and practical solutions. How do you prevent a wealth tax resulting in capital flight, or the risk of less foreign investment? Does he agree with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve\">Laffer Curve</a>? What‚Äôs his answer to the French experience of a wealth tax, which ultimately failed? If part of the solution is taxing capital gains at the same rate as income, how do you change capital gains tax without it adversely impacting the middle class?</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s an economist, so he knows the arguments. He just chooses not to go into details, because, I think, he has this view that it&rsquo;s more important to start with the general message, and maybe us mere mortals are too thick to understand economic theory. It&rsquo;s a little patronising.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve watched and listened to him being interviewed on various channels. These interviews are also mainly patronising - not delving into the academic arguments or challenging him in anyway.</p>\n<p>This is part of the problem. He has become a darling of the left, so most of the interviews so far have been from left-wing broadcasters such as The Guardian, Novara Media, James O&rsquo;Brien, etc,. He has been shouting into the echo chamber. If his campaign is going to work, he needs to reach a broader audience. I&rsquo;d love to see him get interviewed by Andrew Neil on Times Radio. He did get challenged on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03lydX8XHF4&amp;t=3410s\">the Piers Morgan show</a>, but the problem with Piers Morgan is the format. It&rsquo;s no place for a proper, nuanced debate.

				"content_html": "<p>Searching for a job is frustrating. There are multiple job platforms, which means you may end up with a flood of emails from each with job listings based on your search criteria. Often these will display the same jobs. Also often, those jobs will be repeated in job listing emails day after day until the job is no longer available.</p>\n<p>What if there was one platform that pulled in all the job listings from all these platforms? And what if you could use a simple swipe-right or swipe-left action to dismiss the listing or add it as a job of interest? Maybe then, once the job is dismissed, some smart tech could ensure you don&rsquo;t see that job again in future listings?</p>\n<p>That was an idea I pursued for about 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>When pulling in data from other sites, the most common techniques are APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or web scraping.</p>\n<p>In the case of APIs, it relies on 1) the job listing site to have an accessible API that can be used by third parties, and 2) it being free, or affordable enough to make it a worthwhile endeavour.</p>\n<p>In the case of job listings on LinkedIn, for instance, the API favours job postings, rather than job retrieval or job queries. This is for one simple reason - all the large platforms are slowly becoming walled gardens. They&rsquo;re making it increasingly difficulty to use the web in the way it was first intended by Tim Berners-Lee. Instead of the open web, we now have a handful of massive tech companies competing for your eyeballs and advertising dollars. If you click on a link in these platforms, it will often open an in-app browser, sometimes with no option to open the link outside of the app in your own browser. These platforms wants to keep you in their walled garden because that&rsquo;s how they make money. This is fair enough - they&rsquo;re not a charity - but it clearly benefits them more than the user.</p>\n<p>The other way of pulling data is web-scraping. The problem with this is it&rsquo;s legally dubious, at best. It almost certainly breaks the terms and conditions of the platform, and if you attempt to commercialise that data in any way, you will probably end up with a cease and desist letter from a highly paid lawyer.</p>\n<p>Unless, of course, you&rsquo;re already a massive tech company and have essentially scraped the entire web to use for your AI models.</p>\n<p>This is where we may have a future answer - AI, and specifically - agentic AI.</p>\n<p>Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of perceiving their environment, making autonomous decisions, and taking actions without human intervention.</p>\n<p>The idea is, with a simple text prompt, you can ask AI to perform computer-based tasks on your behalf while you go off and do something more interesting.</p>\n<p>OpenAI ChatGPT has demonstrated this with &lsquo;Operator&rsquo;. Microsoft has introduced agents for Co-Pilot. Claude AI (Anthropic) has &lsquo;computer use&rsquo;, and Google has unveiled Project Mariner. Smaller players are also producing demos of similar advances every week.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how these demonstrations typically go:</p>\n<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re researching your next trip. With a simple prompt, you tell AI roughly where and when you want to go, your budget, the kind of things you like to do, etc,. It then autonomously opens a bunch of web browser windows and starts doing the searches for you, and pulls the results into a nicely summarised report with recommendations. You could event prompt it to go ahead and make all the bookings for you. I must have spent months of my life doing travel planning manually, so I can easily understand the appeal of handing this over to AI - an autonomous travel agent.</p>\n<p>When you first see it, it&rsquo;s creepy as hell. The biggest barrier to this taking off is clearly going to be trust. I&rsquo;m certainly not yet ready to give control of my computer over to AI. I know a lot of early adopters are experimenting with it.

				"content_text": "Searching for a job is frustrating. There are multiple job platforms, which means you may end up with a flood of emails from each with job listings based on your search criteria. Often these will display the same jobs. Also often, those jobs will be repeated in job listing emails day after day until the job is no longer available.\n\nWhat if there was one platform that pulled in all the job listings from all these platforms? And what if you could use a simple swipe-right or swipe-left action to dismiss the listing or add it as a job of interest? Maybe then, once the job is dismissed, some smart tech could ensure you don't see that job again in future listings?\n\nThat was an idea I pursued for about 5 minutes.\n\nWhen pulling in data from other sites, the most common techniques are APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or web scraping. \n\nIn the case of APIs, it relies on 1) the job listing site to have an accessible API that can be used by third parties, and 2) it being free, or affordable enough to make it a worthwhile endeavour. \n\nIn the case of job listings on LinkedIn, for instance, the API favours job postings, rather than job retrieval or job queries. This is for one simple reason - all the large platforms are slowly becoming walled gardens. They're making it increasingly difficulty to use the web in the way it was first intended by Tim Berners-Lee. Instead of the open web, we now have a handful of massive tech companies competing for your eyeballs and advertising dollars. If you click on a link in these platforms, it will often open an in-app browser, sometimes with no option to open the link outside of the app in your own browser. These platforms wants to keep you in their walled garden because that's how they make money. This is fair enough - they're not a charity - but it clearly benefits them more than the user.\n\nThe other way of pulling data is web-scraping. The problem with this is it's legally dubious, at best. It almost certainly breaks the terms and conditions of the platform, and if you attempt to commercialise that data in any way, you will probably end up with a cease and desist letter from a highly paid lawyer.\n\nUnless, of course, you're already a massive tech company and have essentially scraped the entire web to use for your AI models.\n\nThis is where we may have a future answer - AI, and specifically - agentic AI.\n\nAgentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of perceiving their environment, making autonomous decisions, and taking actions without human intervention.\n\nThe idea is, with a simple text prompt, you can ask AI to perform computer-based tasks on your behalf while you go off and do something more interesting.\n\nOpenAI ChatGPT has demonstrated this with 'Operator'. Microsoft has introduced agents for Co-Pilot. Claude AI (Anthropic) has 'computer use', and Google has unveiled Project Mariner. Smaller players are also producing demos of similar advances every week.\n\nHere's how these demonstrations typically go: \n\nImagine you're researching your next trip. With a simple prompt, you tell AI roughly where and when you want to go, your budget, the kind of things you like to do, etc,. It then autonomously opens a bunch of web browser windows and starts doing the searches for you, and pulls the results into a nicely summarised report with recommendations. You could event prompt it to go ahead and make all the bookings for you. I must have spent months of my life doing travel planning manually, so I can easily understand the appeal of handing this over to AI - an autonomous travel agent.\n\nWhen you first see it, it's creepy as hell. The biggest barrier to this taking off is clearly going to be trust. I'm certainly not yet ready to give control of my computer over to AI. I know a lot of early adopters are experimenting with it. I'm being a bit more cautious.\n\nHowever, it's coming, and this could solve the job search issue I described earlier.\n\nI foresee a solution where, in the first instance, you hand over control of your email inbox to AI. Again, this is not the future, it's already happening. You ask AI to summarise new job listings that match your criteria, AI then take those listings and add them to a list in another application, which could be simply in a notes app. You then review the listings and delete any you're not interested in. The AI takes note of what you've deleted and ensures they're omitted from any future summaries from your email inbox.\n\nThis is a fairly simple use case. \n\nThe thing about agentic AI is it gets around the web-scraping and AI issue. You can even take out email entirely, and just rely on searching the platforms directly. When prompting the AI, you can give it credentials to log in to LinkedIn as you. The same goes for Indeed, Monster or whatever is your job search platform of choice.\n\nThe question is, what will the platforms do to stop this? Is there anything they can do? If the platform owns the agentic AI solution you're using, they're unlikely to object. As for the others, it will be interesting to see what happens.\n\nI know that there are many, like me, that are longing for the death of Google. The 'don't be evil' mission statement was ditched a long time ago at the alter of pure greed. The result is that Google Search, as a product, is absolutely trash. I stopped using it a long time ago because of privacy concerns. When I look at it now, I don't see the best search results at the top.

There would have been no F√ºhrer without backing from rich businessmen, such as [Alfred Hugenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hugenberg).\n\nI recently watched the excellent Apple TV+ series - [Vietnam: The War That Changed America](https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/vietnam-the-war-that-changed-america/umc.cmc.5louo8zb5eb7zs0dgk06tnk22). The last episode featured a businessman who did stand up and do something.\n\nIn the dying days of the Vietnam War, when American troops had pulled out, and the North Vietnamese Army was marching on Saigon, the American businessman, [Ed Daly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Daly), who was horrified that America would let down an ally, organised humanitarian evacuation flights to rescue South Vietnamese civilians.\n\nIn the same episode, I also learned about [Larry Chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Chambers), who, while in command of USS Midway, defied orders and risked a court-martial in order to save the lives of Republic of Vietnam Air Force Major Buang-Ly and his family. Buang-Ly was circling USS Midway in a Cessna light aircraft, but there was nowhere to land on the cramped carrier deck. Larry Chambers gave the order to push overboard millions of dollars' worth of Huey helicopters to clear room.\n\nThe chaotic scenes in the last days of the Vietnam War would be repeated when America fled from the Taliban in Afghanistan 46 years later.\n\nLess than a year before the evacuation of American civilians and \"at-risk\" Vietnamese from Saigon, Richard Nixon, facing conviction for abuse of power, was forced to resign as President. What would it take for this Congress to stand up to Trump? I dread to think.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat, it rhymes. So they say.\n\n",

A lot of what I‚Äôve learnt has come from social media. The problem, of course, is that most platforms try and serve us ‚Äòcontent you may like‚Äô, not just content from trusted sources you follow. It‚Äôs getting harder and harder to open an app without being distracted by some nonsense.\n\nI definitely class writing as productive time. Take this blog for instance. It serves no purpose other than for the joy of producing something. I don‚Äôt care if nobody reads it. I haven‚Äôt turned on analytics. I haven‚Äôt even turned on comments. It‚Äôs just an outlet, not an asynchronous conversation. Those who do read it may think it‚Äôs mostly drivel. They‚Äôre probably right. I‚Äôm not a journalist. I have no plans to monetise it or post on a regular schedule to feed the beast. \n\nProductivity in itself has long been an obsession. I dread to think how much time and money I‚Äôve spent over the years switching from one productivity app to another. I could write a book on this stuff.\n\nFatigue and financial necessity now means I keep it simple. \n\nI might write about my productivity ‚Äòjourney‚Äô and what I‚Äôve settled on at the moment.\n\nFor now, I‚Äôll finish with this:\n> ‚ÄúIt is not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is: what are we busy about?‚Äù\n‚Äì Henry David Thoreau\n\n",

				"title": "That Year in Music",
				"content_html": "<p>I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm pretty good at guessing the year a song was released - as long as that year was in the 80s.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not too bad at the 60s and 70s, even though I wasn‚Äôt born until 1975.</p>\n<p>I struggle a bit with the 90s. Those were my drinking and sailing years, so it‚Äôs all a bit of a blur (no pun intended - I preferred Oasis). The decade is fairly easy to identify but I‚Äôm usually out by a year or two. I just remember - early 90s: Nirvana and Grunge, as well as pretty crap dance music; mid 90s: BritPop; mid-to-late 90s: Spice Girls, Take That, etc., and the re-emergence of Alt-Rock (Radiohead, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins).</p>\n<p>For the noughties onwards, I‚Äôm ok at identifying the artist or song, but as for the year - useless!</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been trying to think why this is. My initial theory was that we‚Äôre not seeing a revolution in music styles and genres that we saw in earlier decades.</p>\n<p>The 80s in particular were an amazingly diverse time for music. There was so much going on, each genre with its own little sub-culture. You have the New Romantics such as Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran and Culture Club; Goths such as The Cure and The Sisters of Mercy; Glam Metal; Ska-revival; Reggae; Synth Pop; New Wave, Thrash Metal; Post-Punk; the early days of Hip-Hop, House and Techno; and so much more.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs easy to be nostalgic about the 80s.</p>\n<p>There is of course a bias underpinning my love of the 80s. Studies have shown that our musical preferences are shaped during adolescence and early teenage years. For me, that lines up with the 80s, whereas Generation Z ‚Äî born in 2000 or later ‚Äî <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/entertainment/articles/36462-best-decade-for-music-americans-poll-data\">really do believe that the 2010s was the best decade</a>. So was the 80s a uniquely great decade, or is it simply, as science suggests, that I was at an age where my <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9842905/\">orbitofrontal cortex reward system was sensitive and highly engaged</a>?</p>\n<p>I certainly went through a dramatic evolution in musical tastes in my teens. I went from being a <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/artist/bros/17628751\">Bros</a> fan in 1988 with short spiky hair, to a metalhead in 1991 with longish hair, even attending the iconic <a href=\"https://www.setlist.fm/festival/1991/monsters-of-rock-england-1991-73d6b66d.html\">Donington Monsters of Rock Festival that year</a>. Those extremes were short-lived.</p>\n<p>I was never really into cool music at the time it was considered cool. I remember a group of friends being heavily in to The Smiths while I was probably listening to the great works of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_Aitken_Waterman\">Stock Aitken Waterman</a>. Now, of course, I love The Smiths.</p>\n<p>As with many people, I went through that period when I ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô the Beatles. I read the authorised biography of <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781407027524\">the Beatles by Hunter Davies</a> (first published in 1968 - before the split). I love reading biographies about cultural icons because you can make it interactive by listening to, or watching, their work when you get to the corresponding chapter of the book.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Beatles, I followed the book and listened to every album in order, analysed every song, furthered my research with thanks to Wikipedia, documentaries, YouTube and podcasts. I went all in for a while. There‚Äôs a reason why the Beatles are generally considered to be the greatest band of all time. It‚Äôs not just all the record-breaking stats and the phenomenon of Beatlemania. They transformed the music industry. Listen to their music from 1963 and compare it to 1969. Not only did their music evolve, once they gave up touring and spent more time in the studio, they became extremely innovative - pushing the boundaries of recording techniques, songwriting and production. They influenced everyone around them and shaped the evolution of the music industry the 60s and beyond. My favourite Beatles album - <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/album/revolver/1441164670\">Revolver</a>.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend my interactive book experience. I‚Äôve done the same with many other biographies from icons of music, sport, films, politics and historical figures. It‚Äôs like creating your own documentary.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780142181218\">Mike Tyson autobiography</a> is a good example. At the time the book was released, I was able to follow along and watch pretty much every fight on YouTube. Unfortunately, a lot of those videos of his early fights have since been pulled. You can of course watch the highlights of his career but it‚Äôs not the same as watching every fight and hearing, in his own words, what factors influenced his boxing style, mentality and (tragically) the direction of his career. Boxing critics argue on where he stands amongst the greats. I just know that for a time, he was unstoppable. And then, Cus D‚ÄôAmato died, and Don King (and drugs) got their hooks into him. Whether you like him or not, the story is epic, Shakespearean even. Highly recommended.</p>\n<p>Back to music and my inability to guess the year from this century.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt know music. I‚Äôm a bit of a music nerd (no surprise), but not in the traditional sense. It has been a while since I‚Äôve regularly read music magazines or gone to gigs. No, my particular nerdiness is that for over 20 years now I have digitally collected music and rated every single song in my library. I‚Äôm a stats man. Through ratings and extensive use of smart playlists, I could recall, for instance, my favourite rock songs from 1978, or my highest rated dance tracks with a BPM (beats per minute) below 140.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the support for star ratings and smart playlists is the main reason I haven‚Äôt switched from Apple Music to Spotify.</p>\n<p>My digital ratings system started on Windows, I believe around 2000. I think the app was MusicMatch Jukebox. I may be wrong. I also remember using Winamp and later Last.fm. That all changed when Apple released iTunes for Windows in 2003. I had an iPod so the easy syncing made complete sense. I made the full switch to an Apple Mac and iPhone in 2008. They‚Äôve had me locked in ever since!</p>\n<p>Incidentally, Yahoo acquired MusicMatch and then later killed it. Indicative of the general demise of Yahoo from an Internet giant to a footnote.</p>\n<p>My system is simple. If I find a song I instantly like I add it to my library and give it an initial 3 star rating. Many of my playlists have criteria that start with songs rated 3* or greater. These songs will usually go in to my Recently Liked playlist. I regularly review this playlist and try and keep in under 100 songs. Before removing the song I&rsquo;ll review the rating and maybe add it to one of my other playlists.</p>\n<p>If I&rsquo;m on the fence about a song I might add it to my library anyway. This then shows up in my Unrated playlist.  It usually takes 3 or 4 listens to each track before I‚Äôve decided on a rating. Sometimes more. Unfortunately for me, this often means that the yearly Apple Replay playlists that Apple automatically generate are dominated by songs which perhaps weren&rsquo;t my favourites from the year.</p>\n<p>If the song is from an artist I already like I‚Äôll usually add the associated album to my library. If it‚Äôs from a new artist, I might quickly scan through the album to get an idea whether the album stands up to the quality of the single.</p>\n<p>I once made the mistake of adding loads of classic 70s albums to my library in one go. This sent my Unrated playlist up to about 2000 songs. It took me nearly 2 years to get through it. It became more of a chore than enjoyable.</p>\n<p>I now find that I add a lot less new music to my library. Again, studies suggest that once you reach middle age you stop listening to new music. There‚Äôs a reason that BBC Radio 1 and 2 have different demographics. I still listen to new music but it‚Äôs certainly not at the same rate as previous years.</p>\n<p>I think it‚Äôs partly a reflection of age, but also has something to do with the times in which we live. We are in an age of abundant options. It was once second nature to pick up a book while listening to an album on my Walkman. Today, it could take me half an an hour to decide whether to watch a film, TV show, or Youtube, or listen to an audiobook or podcast, perhaps doomscroll the news, get lost in the nonsense on social media, or catch up my never ending RSS blogs feed. I end up falling asleep in decision paralysis.</p>\n<p>It was easier when I had a full-time job. Music helped me concentrate. Now I find I have to make time for music and rely on reminders. I rely on the Friday notification of new album releases on my phone, or the notification from BBC Sounds that there&rsquo;s a new episode of my favourite radio show - <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07jcj7v\">Trevor Nelson&rsquo;s Rhythm Nation</a>.</p>\n<p>My early years were influenced by watching Top of the Pops, listening to the Top 40 countdown on Radio 1 on a Sunday, and reading Smash Hits magazine. I had no money to collect physical albums. It was the days of recording songs off the radio on to cassette tapes. The first ever single I bought with own money was <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/album/i-wanna-dance-with-somebody-who-loves-me/840431884?i=840431935\">I Wanna Dance with Somebody by Whitney Houston</a>. Whitney Houston remains my favourite female vocalist of all time. That would have been on vinyl. If only we had all kept all our vinyl records from back in the day. Who knew they would make a comeback?</p>\n<p>In the 90s I was living on warships so had limited options. In the early 90s that would be a handful of cassette tapes. Later, mp3 players came along but storage was minute. It wasn‚Äôt until the iPod came along in 2001 that you could fit ‚Äò1000 songs in your pocket‚Äô.</p>\n<p>I can remember deployments based on the small number of albums I had on repeat. Each deployment had its own soundtrack. For example, my memory of a specific Arabian Gulf deployment is sunbathing on the flight deck in scorching heat listening to <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/album/whats-the-story-morning-glory/1517447039\">(What‚Äôs the Story) Morning Glory? by Oasis</a>, and <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/album/seal-ii/302788213\">Seal II</a> on constant repeat. That would put it around 1995.</p>\n<p>Today, things are very different. We have millions of songs in our pocket. For a long while my listening was dominated by playlists. I think it‚Äôs the same for most people. More recently, I‚Äôve made a conscious effort to listen to full albums, with songs in order, not shuffled. It‚Äôs a different experience. The great albums tell a story, with a beginning, a middle and an end. It‚Äôs not just a collection of songs.</p>\n<p>Despite my Apple Music subscription, I‚Äôve found the Apple Music app is not the best option for listening to albums. You can of course search, or navigate, to a specific album, but let‚Äôs say you want to listen to a smart playlist of your 5* albums.</p>\n<p>First of all, It‚Äôs 2025 and the Apple Music app on iOS still doesn‚Äôt allow us to create smart playlists. We have to first create them in the Mac app.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there seems to be a long running bug in iTunes, that has carried through to the Apple Music app, where playlists don‚Äôt remember your selected view type or sort criteria. For example, in my nerdiness, I have separate playlists containing the best albums (based on my ratings) for every single year going back to the early 70s. I‚Äôll set the view type of the playlist to ‚Äòas Album‚Äô, sorted based on album rating, but later, both on iOS and MacOS, it will revert to the default, which is as a playlist of all songs based on the order that songs were added to the playlist. First world problems, I know, but frustrating.</p>\n<p>One other problem is that Apple lets you specify the year, but this is the year of the song, not album. There is no separate filter option for album year. This means that sometimes albums might be split across 2 years as album release date and song release date are not always the same. What I end up doing is creating a separate manual playlist for each year based on the results of the corresponding smart playlist. You can see the Album Year in the metadata for an album, it&rsquo;s just not a filtering option.</p>\n<p>On iOS i get around a lot of these problems by using the excellent app <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/marvis-review-the-ultra-customizable-apple-music-client/\">Marvis</a> which let&rsquo;s you create your own customised version of Apple Music, and includes the ability to create smart playlists and keeps the albums view.</p>\n<p>I have lots of playlists and playlist groups. I have an A List group - this contains the playlists I play most often. Then a B List. I have a Favourite Artists group. This contains playlists for dozens of my favourite bands and artists where each playlist just includes the songs from the artists I&rsquo;ve rated as 3* or above - filtering the wheat from the chaff. I have a grouping with smart playlists for different genres. Where the genre is a favourite of mine, such as Soul/RnB, I have separate groupings for these. For example, my Slow Jams playlist is very different to my Motown playlist.</p>\n<p>I have a party grouping, with playlists I&rsquo;ve created over the years for home BBQs, friends round for dinner, or even parties for specific events (for example when we were lucky enough to live in an apartment that had arguably the best view in Brisbane for the annual <a href=\"https://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/whats-on/2025/riverfire-2025\">RiverFire</a> event). I find it hard to delete these playlists - they&rsquo;re a little snapshot of time.</p>\n<p>I have a grouping for Movie and TV soundtrack playlists that I&rsquo;ve created. If I watch a film and really enjoy the score or soundtrack, I&rsquo;ll often create my own playlist if I can&rsquo;t find one shared by another Apple Music user. It&rsquo;s easy to find the music from a film with help from sites such as <a href=\"https://www.tunefind.com\">TuneFind</a>. I&rsquo;ve contributed to TuneFind myself when I&rsquo;ve created a playlist that&rsquo;s either missing entirely or is missing certain tracks.</p>\n<p>I even have different Xmas playlists. My Classy Christmas playlist is very different from my Party Christmas playlist. I have no real naming convention. Sometimes it&rsquo;s obvious, like &rsquo;80s Power Ballads', and sometimes less obvious, like &lsquo;Teenage Wasteland&rsquo;. I know what they all mean.</p>\n<p>You get the picture.</p>\n<p>As of now, I have rated close to 26,000 songs. It would take me 71 days to listen to them all. It&rsquo;s a similar story for films, but let&rsquo;s leave it there. I&rsquo;m starting to re-think my life choices.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm pretty good at guessing the year a song was released - as long as that year was in the 80s. \n\nI‚Äôm not too bad at the 60s and 70s, even though I wasn‚Äôt born until 1975. \n\nI struggle a bit with the 90s. Those were my drinking and sailing years, so it‚Äôs all a bit of a blur (no pun intended - I preferred Oasis). The decade is fairly easy to identify but I‚Äôm usually out by a year or two. I just remember - early 90s: Nirvana and Grunge, as well as pretty crap dance music; mid 90s: BritPop; mid-to-late 90s: Spice Girls, Take That, etc., and the re-emergence of Alt-Rock (Radiohead, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins).\n\nFor the noughties onwards, I‚Äôm ok at identifying the artist or song, but as for the year - useless! \n\nI‚Äôve been trying to think why this is. My initial theory was that we‚Äôre not seeing a revolution in music styles and genres that we saw in earlier decades. \n\nThe 80s in particular were an amazingly diverse time for music. There was so much going on, each genre with its own little sub-culture. You have the New Romantics such as Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran and Culture Club; Goths such as The Cure and The Sisters of Mercy; Glam Metal; Ska-revival; Reggae; Synth Pop; New Wave, Thrash Metal; Post-Punk; the early days of Hip-Hop, House and Techno; and so much more.\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to be nostalgic about the 80s. \n\nThere is of course a bias underpinning my love of the 80s. Studies have shown that our musical preferences are shaped during adolescence and early teenage years. For me, that lines up with the 80s, whereas Generation Z ‚Äî born in 2000 or later ‚Äî [really do believe that the 2010s was the best decade](https://today.yougov.com/entertainment/articles/36462-best-decade-for-music-americans-poll-data). So was the 80s a uniquely great decade, or is it simply, as science suggests, that I was at an age where my [orbitofrontal cortex reward system was sensitive and highly engaged](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9842905/)?\n\nI certainly went through a dramatic evolution in musical tastes in my teens. I went from being a [Bros](https://music.apple.com/gb/artist/bros/17628751) fan in 1988 with short spiky hair, to a metalhead in 1991 with longish hair, even attending the iconic [Donington Monsters of Rock Festival that year](https://www.setlist.fm/festival/1991/monsters-of-rock-england-1991-73d6b66d.html). Those extremes were short-lived.\n\nI was never really into cool music at the time it was considered cool. I remember a group of friends being heavily in to The Smiths while I was probably listening to the great works of [Stock Aitken Waterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_Aitken_Waterman). Now, of course, I love The Smiths.\n\nAs with many people, I went through that period when I ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô the Beatles. I read the authorised biography of [the Beatles by Hunter Davies](https://micro.blog/books/9781407027524) (first published in 1968 - before the split). I love reading biographies about cultural icons because you can make it interactive by listening to, or watching, their work when you get to the corresponding chapter of the book. \n\nIn the case of the Beatles, I followed the book and listened to every album in order, analysed every song, furthered my research with thanks to Wikipedia, documentaries, YouTube and podcasts. I went all in for a while. There‚Äôs a reason why the Beatles are generally considered to be the greatest band of all time. It‚Äôs not just all the record-breaking stats and the phenomenon of Beatlemania. They transformed the music industry. Listen to their music from 1963 and compare it to 1969. Not only did their music evolve, once they gave up touring and spent more time in the studio, they became extremely innovative - pushing the boundaries of recording techniques, songwriting and production. They influenced everyone around them and shaped the evolution of the music industry the 60s and beyond. My favourite Beatles album - [Revolver](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/revolver/1441164670).\n\nI highly recommend my interactive book experience. I‚Äôve done the same with many other biographies from icons of music, sport, films, politics and historical figures. It‚Äôs like creating your own documentary.\n\nThe [Mike Tyson autobiography](https://micro.blog/books/9780142181218) is a good example. At the time the book was released, I was able to follow along and watch pretty much every fight on YouTube. Unfortunately, a lot of those videos of his early fights have since been pulled. You can of course watch the highlights of his career but it‚Äôs not the same as watching every fight and hearing, in his own words, what factors influenced his boxing style, mentality and (tragically) the direction of his career. Boxing critics argue on where he stands amongst the greats. I just know that for a time, he was unstoppable. And then, Cus D‚ÄôAmato died, and Don King (and drugs) got their hooks into him. Whether you like him or not, the story is epic, Shakespearean even. Highly recommended.\n\nBack to music and my inability to guess the year from this century.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt know music. I‚Äôm a bit of a music nerd (no surprise), but not in the traditional sense. It has been a while since I‚Äôve regularly read music magazines or gone to gigs. No, my particular nerdiness is that for over 20 years now I have digitally collected music and rated every single song in my library. I‚Äôm a stats man. Through ratings and extensive use of smart playlists, I could recall, for instance, my favourite rock songs from 1978, or my highest rated dance tracks with a BPM (beats per minute) below 140.\n\nIncidentally, the support for star ratings and smart playlists is the main reason I haven‚Äôt switched from Apple Music to Spotify.\n\nMy digital ratings system started on Windows, I believe around 2000. I think the app was MusicMatch Jukebox. I may be wrong. I also remember using Winamp and later Last.fm. That all changed when Apple released iTunes for Windows in 2003. I had an iPod so the easy syncing made complete sense. I made the full switch to an Apple Mac and iPhone in 2008. They‚Äôve had me locked in ever since!\n\nIncidentally, Yahoo acquired MusicMatch and then later killed it. Indicative of the general demise of Yahoo from an Internet giant to a footnote.\n\nMy system is simple. If I find a song I instantly like I add it to my library and give it an initial 3 star rating. Many of my playlists have criteria that start with songs rated 3* or greater. These songs will usually go in to my Recently Liked playlist. I regularly review this playlist and try and keep in under 100 songs. Before removing the song I'll review the rating and maybe add it to one of my other playlists.\n\nIf I'm on the fence about a song I might add it to my library anyway. This then shows up in my Unrated playlist.  It usually takes 3 or 4 listens to each track before I‚Äôve decided on a rating. Sometimes more. Unfortunately for me, this often means that the yearly Apple Replay playlists that Apple automatically generate are dominated by songs which perhaps weren't my favourites from the year.\n\nIf the song is from an artist I already like I‚Äôll usually add the associated album to my library. If it‚Äôs from a new artist, I might quickly scan through the album to get an idea whether the album stands up to the quality of the single.\n\nI once made the mistake of adding loads of classic 70s albums to my library in one go. This sent my Unrated playlist up to about 2000 songs. It took me nearly 2 years to get through it. It became more of a chore than enjoyable.\n\nI now find that I add a lot less new music to my library. Again, studies suggest that once you reach middle age you stop listening to new music. There‚Äôs a reason that BBC Radio 1 and 2 have different demographics. I still listen to new music but it‚Äôs certainly not at the same rate as previous years. \n\nI think it‚Äôs partly a reflection of age, but also has something to do with the times in which we live. We are in an age of abundant options. It was once second nature to pick up a book while listening to an album on my Walkman. Today, it could take me half an an hour to decide whether to watch a film, TV show, or Youtube, or listen to an audiobook or podcast, perhaps doomscroll the news, get lost in the nonsense on social media, or catch up my never ending RSS blogs feed. I end up falling asleep in decision paralysis. \n\nIt was easier when I had a full-time job. Music helped me concentrate. Now I find I have to make time for music and rely on reminders. I rely on the Friday notification of new album releases on my phone, or the notification from BBC Sounds that there's a new episode of my favourite radio show - [Trevor Nelson's Rhythm Nation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07jcj7v).\n\nMy early years were influenced by watching Top of the Pops, listening to the Top 40 countdown on Radio 1 on a Sunday, and reading Smash Hits magazine. I had no money to collect physical albums. It was the days of recording songs off the radio on to cassette tapes. The first ever single I bought with own money was [I Wanna Dance with Somebody by Whitney Houston](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/i-wanna-dance-with-somebody-who-loves-me/840431884?i=840431935). Whitney Houston remains my favourite female vocalist of all time. That would have been on vinyl. If only we had all kept all our vinyl records from back in the day. Who knew they would make a comeback?\n\nIn the 90s I was living on warships so had limited options. In the early 90s that would be a handful of cassette tapes.

				"content_html": "<p>I woke up this morning with a feeling of dread. For once, it was nothing to do with my health problems. No, I quickly remembered that today is Inauguration Day for President Trump.</p>\n<p>What will we have in store for this term? He is an agent of chaos. Completely unpredictable. Anything can happen. I can feel the jitters everywhere - from immigrants, European politicians,  Ukrainians, financial markets, you name it.</p>\n<p>Just in the last 48 hours, before he has even taken the oath of office, he has already enriched himself by launching a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/20/tech/meme-coins-donald-melania-trump-intl-hnk/index.html\">meme coin cryptocurrency</a>, increasing his net worth by many billions. This tells you everything about where his priorities lie.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tiktok\">TikTok</h2>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends\">TikTok debacle</a>. For those not paying attention, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) was signed into law back in April, with bipartisan support, requiring ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, to either divest its holdings to a US buyer or be shut down in the US by the 19th Jan 2025.</p>\n<p>Despite what you may hear, the Act may have been written with TikTok in mind but it has a broad scope and can be applied to any app owned by a foreign adversary such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran. It just requires a national security review to designate the app as a threat.</p>\n<p>In the case of TikTok, behind-doors intelligence briefings were given to the Senate Intelligence Committee and House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which helped shape the legislation and convince them of the risk posed.</p>\n<p>Most news articles focus on the risk to data privacy. I think the bigger threat is the potential manipulation of the algorithm.</p>\n<p>Social media apps with billions of users have the power to enact social engineering on an enormous scale. There&rsquo;s a massive social experiment going on right now and we&rsquo;re all human guinea pigs. This isn&rsquo;t limited to TikTok. Facebook wrote the book on this stuff.</p>\n<p>The particular problem with Chinese-owned apps is all Chinese companies, including foreign subsidiaries, are subject to the National Intelligence Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China (2017). Article 7 requires individuals and organisations to cooperate with state intelligence work, and not disclose to anyone the cooperation. Article 16 gives CCP intelligence agencies broad authority to conduct intelligence oversight of businesses.</p>\n<p>We already know that social media can play a significant role in shaping opinions. The algorithm dictates what you see in your feed. It can, and already has, shaped elections. It can foment anger and divisiveness by prioritising content that supports a particular opinion, and downgrading content that supports the opposite opinion.</p>\n<p>Traditional news media has done this forever. We all know about Fox News, but let&rsquo;s take the supposedly impartial BBC as an example. You don&rsquo;t have to conduct statistical analysis of news posts to know that the BBC prominently published any news that was critical of Brexit, and downranked or failed to publish articles that were supportive of Brexit. The same is happening now with regards to Israel and Gaza. It&rsquo;s bias by omission, and It&rsquo;s institutional bias because the editorial teams are human beings.</p>\n<p>Many years ago I read &lsquo;My Trade: A Short History of British Journalism&rsquo; by Andrew Marr. Published in 2004, Marr stated:</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúThe BBC is not impartial or neutral. It‚Äôs a publicly funded, urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people, ethnic minorities, and gay people. It has a liberal bias, not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>In the case of social media apps, instead of editorial decisions, we have algorithms, written by humans, that have in-built bias. That&rsquo;s a significant problem when the owners are subject to the objectives of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>\n<p>With regards to data privacy, yes that&rsquo;s an issue, but that ship sailed a long time ago. Vast swathes of everyone&rsquo;s personal data is already in the hands of data brokers, and the CCP can easily buy the data any time they want.</p>\n<p>Back to what happened yesterday. In compliance with the law, and after the Supreme Court upheld the law, TikTok shut down operations in the US. Then, Donald Trump, who isn&rsquo;t even in office yet, posted on his Truth Social that gave assurance that he would give TikTok a 90 days reprieve. He&rsquo;s now offering that ByteDance US can be 50% owned by a US company instead of full divestment. TikTok was down for all of 14 hours before they restored services, in violation of US law. As of writing, Google and Apple are not yet playing ball - the apps can&rsquo;t be downloaded from the Apple App Store of Google Play Store. This doesn&rsquo;t effect users who have already installed the apps.</p>\n<p>TikTok services in the US are hosted by Oracle, and their Content Delivery Network (CDN) is provided by Akamai. Let&rsquo;s not forget, Larry Ellison, the co-founder and Chairman of Oracle, helped Trump&rsquo;s best mate Elon Musk buy Twitter. He personally donated $1 billion of the $44 billion purchase price.</p>\n<p>Join the dots. This is all a big scam. Trump negotiates behind the scenes. TikTok goes down, then gets restored, and TikTok posts a message on its app thanking their saviour Donald Trump. Shou Zi Chew, the CEO of TikTok, is attending the Inauguration. Unlike Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and the rest of the US technocracy, we don&rsquo;t know if he made any financial contributions to the inauguration committee, because donations by foreign individuals are illegal under US law.</p>\n<p>One interesting point amidst all of this is that Senator Tom Cotton, Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, tweeted the following:</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Any company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs. Think about it.&quot;</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1881038993875140640\">https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1881038993875140640</a></p>\n<p>Perhaps a prediction of what is to come. Maybe Donald Trump will not have it all his own way, despite Republican control of both houses of Congress.</p>\n<p>Deciphering Donald Trump is harder than explaining the plot of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/tenet/\">Tenet</a> to a toddler. He previously supported the TikTok ban. Does he now like TikTok because he believed it helped him win the election? Is he cooking up a scheme to try and get ByteDance to sell TikTok to his mate Elon Musk? Who knows. All that can be said is that whatever decision he makes, his own interests will trump (no pun intended) any national security interests, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>\n<p>Ominously, In <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-farewell-address-oval-office-8bc6051c20adc1bc212cdd8be2578624?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">his farewell address on January 15</a>, President Biden expressed deep concerns about the emergence of an oligarchy in the United States. He highlighted the concentration of wealth and power among a small group of ultra-wealthy individuals, stating that this trend poses a significant threat to democracy, basic rights, and freedoms, specifically referring to the ‚Äútech-industrial complex‚Äù.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tariffs\">Tariffs</h2>\n<p>Donald Trump thinks the answer to all US problems is tariffs. What he says and does are two different things but he has stated that he will set a 60% tariff on all imports from China, a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, and a 10-20% tariffs on imports from everywhere else. He threatened BRICS nations with a 100% tariffs if they dared to set up a reserve currency to challenge the US dollar.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s going by 1920&rsquo;s protectionist policies that aim to roll back globalisation and force companies to increase the industrial base in the US.</p>\n<p>The goal of national self-sufficiency is understandable, but economists argue on the impacts of his proposals. At least we have data from his first term. Tariffs raised the prices of components from overseas (there&rsquo;s many raw components that the US doesn&rsquo;t produce or is cheaper to buy overseas).

				"content_text": "I woke up this morning with a feeling of dread. For once, it was nothing to do with my health problems. No, I quickly remembered that today is Inauguration Day for President Trump.\n\nWhat will we have in store for this term? He is an agent of chaos. Completely unpredictable. Anything can happen. I can feel the jitters everywhere - from immigrants, European politicians,  Ukrainians, financial markets, you name it.\n\nJust in the last 48 hours, before he has even taken the oath of office, he has already enriched himself by launching a [meme coin cryptocurrency](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/20/tech/meme-coins-donald-melania-trump-intl-hnk/index.html), increasing his net worth by many billions. This tells you everything about where his priorities lie.\n\n## TikTok\n\nThen there's the [TikTok debacle](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends). For those not paying attention, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) was signed into law back in April, with bipartisan support, requiring ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, to either divest its holdings to a US buyer or be shut down in the US by the 19th Jan 2025.\n\nDespite what you may hear, the Act may have been written with TikTok in mind but it has a broad scope and can be applied to any app owned by a foreign adversary such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran. It just requires a national security review to designate the app as a threat.\n\nIn the case of TikTok, behind-doors intelligence briefings were given to the Senate Intelligence Committee and House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which helped shape the legislation and convince them of the risk posed.\n\nMost news articles focus on the risk to data privacy. I think the bigger threat is the potential manipulation of the algorithm. \n\nSocial media apps with billions of users have the power to enact social engineering on an enormous scale. There's a massive social experiment going on right now and we're all human guinea pigs. This isn't limited to TikTok. Facebook wrote the book on this stuff.\n\nThe particular problem with Chinese-owned apps is all Chinese companies, including foreign subsidiaries, are subject to the National Intelligence Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China (2017). Article 7 requires individuals and organisations to cooperate with state intelligence work, and not disclose to anyone the cooperation. Article 16 gives CCP intelligence agencies broad authority to conduct intelligence oversight of businesses.\n\nWe already know that social media can play a significant role in shaping opinions. The algorithm dictates what you see in your feed. It can, and already has, shaped elections. It can foment anger and divisiveness by prioritising content that supports a particular opinion, and downgrading content that supports the opposite opinion.\n\nTraditional news media has done this forever. We all know about Fox News, but let's take the supposedly impartial BBC as an example. You don't have to conduct statistical analysis of news posts to know that the BBC prominently published any news that was critical of Brexit, and downranked or failed to publish articles that were supportive of Brexit. The same is happening now with regards to Israel and Gaza. It's bias by omission, and It's institutional bias because the editorial teams are human beings. \n\nMany years ago I read 'My Trade: A Short History of British Journalism' by Andrew Marr. Published in 2004, Marr stated:\n\n*‚ÄúThe BBC is not impartial or neutral. It‚Äôs a publicly funded, urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people, ethnic minorities, and gay people. It has a liberal bias, not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias.‚Äù*\n\nIn the case of social media apps, instead of editorial decisions, we have algorithms, written by humans, that have in-built bias. That's a significant problem when the owners are subject to the objectives of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nWith regards to data privacy, yes that's an issue, but that ship sailed a long time ago. Vast swathes of everyone's personal data is already in the hands of data brokers, and the CCP can easily buy the data any time they want.\n\nBack to what happened yesterday. In compliance with the law, and after the Supreme Court upheld the law, TikTok shut down operations in the US. Then, Donald Trump, who isn't even in office yet, posted on his Truth Social that gave assurance that he would give TikTok a 90 days reprieve. He's now offering that ByteDance US can be 50% owned by a US company instead of full divestment. TikTok was down for all of 14 hours before they restored services, in violation of US law. As of writing, Google and Apple are not yet playing ball - the apps can't be downloaded from the Apple App Store of Google Play Store. This doesn't effect users who have already installed the apps.\n\nTikTok services in the US are hosted by Oracle, and their Content Delivery Network (CDN) is provided by Akamai. Let's not forget, Larry Ellison, the co-founder and Chairman of Oracle, helped Trump's best mate Elon Musk buy Twitter. He personally donated $1 billion of the $44 billion purchase price.\n\nJoin the dots. This is all a big scam. Trump negotiates behind the scenes. TikTok goes down, then gets restored, and TikTok posts a message on its app thanking their saviour Donald Trump. Shou Zi Chew, the CEO of TikTok, is attending the Inauguration. Unlike Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and the rest of the US technocracy, we don't know if he made any financial contributions to the inauguration committee, because donations by foreign individuals are illegal under US law. \n\nOne interesting point amidst all of this is that Senator Tom Cotton, Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, tweeted the following:\n\n*\"Any company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs. Think about it.\"*\n\n[https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1881038993875140640](https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1881038993875140640)\n\nPerhaps a prediction of what is to come. Maybe Donald Trump will not have it all his own way, despite Republican control of both houses of Congress.\n\nDeciphering Donald Trump is harder than explaining the plot of [Tenet](https://letterboxd.com/film/tenet/) to a toddler. He previously supported the TikTok ban. Does he now like TikTok because he believed it helped him win the election? Is he cooking up a scheme to try and get ByteDance to sell TikTok to his mate Elon Musk? Who knows. All that can be said is that whatever decision he makes, his own interests will trump (no pun intended) any national security interests, that's for sure.\n\nOminously, In [his farewell address on January 15](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-farewell-address-oval-office-8bc6051c20adc1bc212cdd8be2578624?utm_source=chatgpt.com), President Biden expressed deep concerns about the emergence of an oligarchy in the United States. He highlighted the concentration of wealth and power among a small group of ultra-wealthy individuals, stating that this trend poses a significant threat to democracy, basic rights, and freedoms, specifically referring to the ‚Äútech-industrial complex‚Äù.\n\n## Tariffs\n\nDonald Trump thinks the answer to all US problems is tariffs. What he says and does are two different things but he has stated that he will set a 60% tariff on all imports from China, a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, and a 10-20% tariffs on imports from everywhere else. He threatened BRICS nations with a 100% tariffs if they dared to set up a reserve currency to challenge the US dollar.\n\nHe's going by 1920's protectionist policies that aim to roll back globalisation and force companies to increase the industrial base in the US.\n\nThe goal of national self-sufficiency is understandable, but economists argue on the impacts of his proposals. At least we have data from his first term. Tariffs raised the prices of components from overseas (there's many raw components that the US doesn't produce or is cheaper to buy overseas). Of course, these costs get passed on to the end customer, raising prices. Many countries, including China and the European Union, imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, negatively affecting industries such as agriculture and manufacturing. Studies suggest that the tariffs slightly dampened U.S. GDP growth during Trump‚Äôs first term, as they disrupted trade flows and increased costs.\n\nThis time, he's promising to go further and harder.\n\n## Ukraine\n\nThere's a lot to worry about a Trump second term. The mass deportation of illegal immigrants is probably going to cause chaos, whether you agree with the plans or not. There's also the unforeseen. It's clear to me from his handling of COVID and the Black Lives Matter protests that he's unpredictable and terrible in a crisis.\n\nThe thing that most worries me though is Ukraine.\n\nDuring his election campaign he stated that he would end the Ukraine war in 24 hrs. Obviously that was nonsense and he's now saying maybe 6 months.\n\nReports suggest that he's going to push both sides for a negotiated settlement or ceasefire. The negotiated settlement would require Ukraine to give up sovereign territory. Both sides have already rejected a ceasefire on the basis it would just allow their opponents to re-arm.\n\nThere's still a big question around his relationship with President Putin. The new MAGA Republican party seemingly has a love of dictators. This started with Donald Trump's fondness for Putin, but where does that come from? Is it simply a case that he sees himself as a strongman and so likes leaders with common traits? Or his he compromised, as suggested by the Christopher Steele dossier? The truth is probably somewhere in-between. \n\nWe know from the Mueller Investigation that there was collusion between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign that helped him win the 2016 election.

The Trump Administration provided training to Ukraine and armaments, including Javelin missiles that have played a crucial role in Ukraine's defence.\n\nOn the other hand, he has surrounded himself with loyalists that are openly opposed to providing further military and financial assistance to Ukraine, particularly his Vice-President pick, J.D. Vance.\n\nHe is also threatening to pull out of NATO again unless countries increase defence expenditure. This is fair enough but this time he is demanding countries spend 5% of GDP on defence. A figure that most countries, including the UK, has no hope of reaching.\n\nLuckily, Ukraine is in a much stronger position now than it was perhaps a year ago.

Significantly, with the investment from allies, Ukraine is now able to [domestically produce 96% of its drones](https://ukrainetoday.org/drone-production-in-ukraine-the-ministry-of-defense-has-revealed-stunning-figures/) on the front line. \n\nThe EU has never taken a leading role, in comparison to the US, but at least in October the EU approved a loan of up to ‚Ç¨35 billion for Ukraine.

EE and Vodafone have already completed the shutdown. Three plan to have theirs completed by the end of the year. O2 intends to begin the process in 2025.\n\nMy observations has been when 5G isn‚Äôt available, my phone switches to 3G, not 4G, indicating that 4G coverage is also lacking. A lot of the time I'm switched on to 2G. 2G is passable for making voice calls but useless for handling today's apps and websites.\n\nMy experience is purely anecdotal. I haven‚Äôt studied the network coverage maps, but in 2024, I didn‚Äôt think I would need to.\n\nI notice that [Elon Musk's Starlink is already doing deals with the major telcos ](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860705853604790414?s=46&t=m1AIkz9IHQYH_jpYy1vCcg)to add Starlink satellite coverage. This could be a game changer if the UK telcos get onboard, at least for outside coverage. Of course, Starlink satellite is no good indoors, unless you have a receiver. Then again, [allowing a nutty billionaire to control the majority of the world's commercial satellite coverage](https://darylhaines.com/2024/10/21/book-review-elon.html) presents its own problems.\n\nHow long will it be before we see a vast improvement to 4G and 5G coverage? Judging by the last 17 years, much longer than the telcos say, that's my bet.\n\nBritain has a lot of old pubs where mobile reception doesn't penetrate the thick walls. 5G is much better at penetrating walls, as long as there's a 5G tower/base station/cell, etc. in range. In this case, I don't mind in the least - pubs are a great place for switching off.\n\nEverywhere else - come on! The UK is not a large country. It shouldn‚Äôt be this way.\n\n",

				"title": "Book Review: Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson",
				"content_html": "<p>I recently finished reading: <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781982181284\">Elon Musk</a> the authorised biography by Walter Isaacson üìö, who also wrote the authorised biography of Steve Jobs shortly before he died. I mention it because there are some clear similarities between Elon Musk and Steve Jobs, which I&rsquo;m sure is not news to anyone.</p>\n<p>When I read biographies about business tycoons I&rsquo;m never much interested in the sections on their personal lives, except for as much as it goes someway to explain their personalities, what drives them, and some of the factors that may have led to their successes and failures.</p>\n<p>The book delves into Musk&rsquo;s personal life and childhood, and it&rsquo;s clear how his relationship with his father and his experiences of being bullied at school influenced him later in life.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk is a complicated man. It&rsquo;s very easy to write him off as some right-wing nut-job, as many have.</p>\n<p>Since he bought Twitter (now X), started spouting conspiracy theories, and is now an active Trump supporter, troves of seemingly sensible people suddenly decided that he his akin to Hitler. What&rsquo;s more, they then used this as a justification to write nonsense undermining what he has achieved. According to a lot of journalists and others that I follow online, the case goes that Musk isn&rsquo;t a very good engineer, he&rsquo;s been lucky, he&rsquo;s not a genius and just takes credit for the work of his staff. Blah, blah, blah.</p>\n<p>Of course, no man is an island and he could not have achieved what he has unless he hired brilliant engineers. The question is though, could the engineers have achieved success if they weren&rsquo;t driven by a hugely demanding, difficult boss who sets near impossible goals? Could Apple have come back from near bankruptcy in the 90&rsquo;s if Steve Jobs had not returned and set the company on a new path?</p>\n<p>Like him or loathe him, it&rsquo;s clear to me that Elon Musk is one of those once in a generation entrepreneurs who you would hate to work for, but who really is changing the world.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could work for him, but I understand those who do. If you go to work for one of Elon&rsquo;s companies you know what you&rsquo;re letting yourself in for. For a start, there&rsquo;s zero job security. He fires people on a whim. He personalises blame - lashing out at individuals for the slightest transgression. The result is a culture of immense pressure and fear. However, if you have a thick-skin and are confident in your abilities, the upside is that you get to work on career-defining projects that could potentially change the world. Not to mention the potential for excellent renumeration and share options which could set you up financially for life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"elon-musk-companies\">Elon Musk Companies</h2>\n<p>As a reminder, this is where we currently are with Elon Musk&rsquo;s portfolio of companies:</p>\n<h3 id=\"tesla\">Tesla</h3>\n<p>Musk has played a transformative role in the electric vehicle industry. I think it would be hard to argue that we would be seeing as many electric vehicles on the road today if Tesla has not led the way. As with some of his other companies, Tesla wasn&rsquo;t an immediate success. It very nearly went bankrupt and things could be a whole lot different now if his risk-taking had not paid off. His companies are very much interconnected. If Tesla had failed, this would have had a clear knock-on affect on his ability to develop the other businesses.</p>\n<p>Despite what he tells people, Musk is not a founder of Tesla. Martin Eberhard probably deserves the most credit. Yet it&rsquo;s really only when Musk became the largest investor, took over day-to-day and started making product decisions that Tesla became a success.</p>\n<p>Just last week I watched the Robotaxi event where he unveiled the self-driving cars that he&rsquo;s betting will turn Tesla into a 10 trillion dollar company. His vision is that we will be seeing fleets of these all over the world and most people will not be interested in buying a car anymore. It will make more financial sense just to hop into one of these. Who knows whether he&rsquo;s right. Only time will tell. Only a fool would bet against him though (just like the many fools who shorted Tesla stock).</p>\n<p>Just like Steve Jobs, he seems to have the reality distortion field. Every year since 2016 he has been saying that full self-driving is only a year away. In his defence, he openly admits that he&rsquo;s extremely optimistic in his timeframes. The Robotaxi event, of course, failed to mention that Weymo (owned by Alphabet, who own Google) already have driver-less taxis on the roads in Phoenix, San Francisco, and is rolling them out to L.A and Austin, Texas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"spacex\">SpaceX</h3>\n<p>The achievements he has made with SpaceX are mind-blowing. Again, only last week we were able to watch visions of the Super Heavy Booster from the Starship rocket launch, separate, and then land back on its launch pad - caught by mechanical arms, nicknamed &ldquo;Chopsticks&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The progress with SpaceX is astonishing. Again, this was all due to massive risk-taking. At the beginning, if the company had just one more rocket failure it would have been game over - no more money to keep trying and no NASA contract.</p>\n<p>To think that now SpaceX is responsible for launching 90% of all payload worldwide that goes into space.</p>\n<p>SpaceX also has Starlink - the constellation of thousands of low-orbit satellites that are providing fast broadband to pretty much every corner of the earth. It&rsquo;s incredible, and slightly concerning, where this is going. Starlink can now compete with most ISP&rsquo;s around the world, and for dictatorships who control citizen&rsquo;s internet access I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very worrying. For the rest of us, it creates questions of what power this gives Elon Musk. We have already seen what happened when he decided to take unilateral action to shut off Starlink for Ukraine&rsquo;s assault on Crimea. Thankfully, that issue was resolved by delegating authority to the pentagon to make those decisions. We really don&rsquo;t want lone billionaire businessmen to have the ability to impact wars and geo-politics, yet this is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-boring-company\">The Boring Company</h3>\n<p>A great name for a company. His aim is to revolutionise urban transportation by building underground tunnels to reduce traffic congestions. A short tunnel has been completed in Las Vegas but we&rsquo;re a long way from knowing whether or not this will be a success.</p>\n<h3 id=\"neuralink\">Neuralink</h3>\n<p>Another of Musk&rsquo;s companies where you can&rsquo;t help but be in awe of what&rsquo;s being achieved. It&rsquo;s not the only company to be working on brain-computer interfaces to help cure paralysis, blindness and other neurological conditions, but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet against Neuralink eventually being a winner in the race.</p>\n<h3 id=\"twitter-x\">Twitter (X)</h3>\n<p>Musk acquired Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion and immediately took it private. The changes he has made has reportedly resulted in advertisers fleeing the company in droves and many doubt that X is worth anywhere near $44 billion now. He&rsquo;s clearly playing the long game though. He has said his aim his for X to be like one of the big Chinese apps which basically does everything.</p>\n<p>Twitter is a fascinating example of his core business philosophies at play. He waltzed in there (carrying a sink and tweeting &lsquo;Let that sink in&rsquo;) and quickly got to work laying off 75% of staff. Many commentators tweeted and wrote with glee that Twitter would start to fail within days. After all, you can&rsquo;t lay off that amount of staff and still expect the servers to keep running, can you?</p>\n<p>Again, his risk-taking seems to have worked. Twitter stayed up and running.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve read all kinds of nonsense about how X is now a cesspool because of the lack of moderation. That&rsquo;s not been my experience at all. If anything, it has improved. Whether you agree with him or not, his principle around content moderation has been freedom of speech but not freedom of reach. If you look for objectionable content on X you can find it, but that&rsquo;s it, you have to go looking. I found that my Twitter feed used to be full of angry political content whether I wanted it or not. Today, that&rsquo;s not the case. If you unfollow people who tweet politics, and make it clear to the algorithm that you don&rsquo;t want political content (by flagging users and posts you are not interested in), you won&rsquo;t see it. That&rsquo;s my results at least.</p>\n<p>As soon as Musk took over Twitter there was a mass exodus of users who objected to his politics and the changes he was planning. The result was, for me anyway, it actually made the platform better. Those who left tended to be the opinionated gob-shites who couldn&rsquo;t help themselves to espousing their political views every 5 minutes.

He has a massive advantage. Hundreds of millions of hours of video content from Tesla cars combined with millions of tweets per hour from X gives him a huge amount of content to train neural networks. The race is on and the more competition the better it is for all of us. At least in Musk&rsquo;s case he is very concerned about AI safety. There&rsquo;s an extremely concerning passage in the book where he talks to Larry Page (Google) about AI safety and Page dismisses the risks, accusing Musk of being a &ldquo;specist&rdquo; (biased in favour of humans). It is partly this conversation that led Musk to co-found OpenAI, as a counter to Google&rsquo;s dominance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"business-learnings\">Business Learnings</h2>\n<p>So what are they key traits and business philosophies of Elon Musk that has led to his success. Here&rsquo;s what I have summarised from the book:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>First Principles</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>First principles thinking means he breaks down complex problems to their most basic components and then builds solutions from scratch. For example, at SpaceX he developed an &ldquo;idiot index&rdquo; to highlight the ridiculous costs of components. He pressured suppliers into reducing prices by demonstrating how the cost he was paying for raw materials for Tesla parts was substantially cheaper than what was being charged for SpaceX. It seems that using the words Aeronautics or Defence when making purchases is akin to saying the word &lsquo;Wedding&rsquo; at a flower shop. Everything immediately quadruples in price!</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Relentless Efficiency</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Musk is obsessed with cost cutting and pays attention to the cost of every part of the process. He challenges every assumption and product specification. If a product spec says that a panel needs 5 rivets, he would get the engineers to test it with 3 rivets and take on the safety risk. At Tesla, he implemented a five-step algorithm for product development that included questioning every requirement, deleting unnecessary parts, simplifying proccesses, accelerating timelines, and only then automating the process.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>High Standards</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Musk sets extraordinarily high standards for product quality, obsessing over every detail. It&rsquo;s not enough that the product functionally works, it must also be beautiful and innovative. As an example, during the development of the Tesla Roadster, Musk insisted on modifying the Lotus body even though it increased costs and complexity.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Accountability and Feedback</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Musk has zero-tolerance to failure. He expects accountability from every member of his teams and often attributes failure to individuals, rather than teams, delivering harsh feedback. His review meetings are described as brutal. There are countless stories of him calling meetings at 11pm at night and requiring staff to immediately fly in that night from wherever they are in the country.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Risk Tolerance</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Musk believes in taking big risks and failing fast. You see this with a lot of the big tech companies. The &ldquo;move fast and break things&rdquo; philosophy certainly didn&rsquo;t start with Elon Musk but he has embraced it with gusto. At SpaceX he pushed engineers to break engines during testing to understand their limits. He ordered engineers to redesign the Starship&rsquo;s rocket&rsquo;s heat shield with stainless steel - a massive risk that paid off with new efficiencies. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that NASA would have taken the same risk.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Hardcore Work Ethic</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Shortly after taking over Twitter, he sent out an email to all staff demanding that they work long hours at high intensity.

				"content_text": "I recently finished reading: [Elon Musk](https://micro.blog/books/9781982181284) the authorised biography by Walter Isaacson üìö, who also wrote the authorised biography of Steve Jobs shortly before he died. I mention it because there are some clear similarities between Elon Musk and Steve Jobs, which I'm sure is not news to anyone.\n\nWhen I read biographies about business tycoons I'm never much interested in the sections on their personal lives, except for as much as it goes someway to explain their personalities, what drives them, and some of the factors that may have led to their successes and failures.\n\nThe book delves into Musk's personal life and childhood, and it's clear how his relationship with his father and his experiences of being bullied at school influenced him later in life.\n\nElon Musk is a complicated man. It's very easy to write him off as some right-wing nut-job, as many have.\n\nSince he bought Twitter (now X), started spouting conspiracy theories, and is now an active Trump supporter, troves of seemingly sensible people suddenly decided that he his akin to Hitler. What's more, they then used this as a justification to write nonsense undermining what he has achieved. According to a lot of journalists and others that I follow online, the case goes that Musk isn't a very good engineer, he's been lucky, he's not a genius and just takes credit for the work of his staff. Blah, blah, blah.\n\nOf course, no man is an island and he could not have achieved what he has unless he hired brilliant engineers. The question is though, could the engineers have achieved success if they weren't driven by a hugely demanding, difficult boss who sets near impossible goals? Could Apple have come back from near bankruptcy in the 90's if Steve Jobs had not returned and set the company on a new path?\n\nLike him or loathe him, it's clear to me that Elon Musk is one of those once in a generation entrepreneurs who you would hate to work for, but who really is changing the world.\n\nI don't think I could work for him, but I understand those who do. If you go to work for one of Elon's companies you know what you're letting yourself in for. For a start, there's zero job security. He fires people on a whim. He personalises blame - lashing out at individuals for the slightest transgression. The result is a culture of immense pressure and fear. However, if you have a thick-skin and are confident in your abilities, the upside is that you get to work on career-defining projects that could potentially change the world. Not to mention the potential for excellent renumeration and share options which could set you up financially for life.\n\n## Elon Musk Companies\n\nAs a reminder, this is where we currently are with Elon Musk's portfolio of companies:\n\n### Tesla\n\nMusk has played a transformative role in the electric vehicle industry. I think it would be hard to argue that we would be seeing as many electric vehicles on the road today if Tesla has not led the way. As with some of his other companies, Tesla wasn't an immediate success. It very nearly went bankrupt and things could be a whole lot different now if his risk-taking had not paid off. His companies are very much interconnected. If Tesla had failed, this would have had a clear knock-on affect on his ability to develop the other businesses.\n\nDespite what he tells people, Musk is not a founder of Tesla. Martin Eberhard probably deserves the most credit. Yet it's really only when Musk became the largest investor, took over day-to-day and started making product decisions that Tesla became a success.\n\nJust last week I watched the Robotaxi event where he unveiled the self-driving cars that he's betting will turn Tesla into a 10 trillion dollar company. His vision is that we will be seeing fleets of these all over the world and most people will not be interested in buying a car anymore. It will make more financial sense just to hop into one of these. Who knows whether he's right. Only time will tell. Only a fool would bet against him though (just like the many fools who shorted Tesla stock).\n\nJust like Steve Jobs, he seems to have the reality distortion field. Every year since 2016 he has been saying that full self-driving is only a year away. In his defence, he openly admits that he's extremely optimistic in his timeframes. The Robotaxi event, of course, failed to mention that Weymo (owned by Alphabet, who own Google) already have driver-less taxis on the roads in Phoenix, San Francisco, and is rolling them out to L.A and Austin, Texas.\n\n### SpaceX\n\nThe achievements he has made with SpaceX are mind-blowing. Again, only last week we were able to watch visions of the Super Heavy Booster from the Starship rocket launch, separate, and then land back on its launch pad - caught by mechanical arms, nicknamed \"Chopsticks\".\n\nThe progress with SpaceX is astonishing. Again, this was all due to massive risk-taking. At the beginning, if the company had just one more rocket failure it would have been game over - no more money to keep trying and no NASA contract.\n\nTo think that now SpaceX is responsible for launching 90% of all payload worldwide that goes into space.\n\nSpaceX also has Starlink - the constellation of thousands of low-orbit satellites that are providing fast broadband to pretty much every corner of the earth. It's incredible, and slightly concerning, where this is going. Starlink can now compete with most ISP's around the world, and for dictatorships who control citizen's internet access I'm sure it's very worrying. For the rest of us, it creates questions of what power this gives Elon Musk. We have already seen what happened when he decided to take unilateral action to shut off Starlink for Ukraine's assault on Crimea. Thankfully, that issue was resolved by delegating authority to the pentagon to make those decisions. We really don't want lone billionaire businessmen to have the ability to impact wars and geo-politics, yet this is what's happening.\n\n### The Boring Company\n\nA great name for a company. His aim is to revolutionise urban transportation by building underground tunnels to reduce traffic congestions. A short tunnel has been completed in Las Vegas but we're a long way from knowing whether or not this will be a success.\n\n### Neuralink\n\nAnother of Musk's companies where you can't help but be in awe of what's being achieved. It's not the only company to be working on brain-computer interfaces to help cure paralysis, blindness and other neurological conditions, but I wouldn't bet against Neuralink eventually being a winner in the race.\n\n### Twitter (X)\n\nMusk acquired Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion and immediately took it private. The changes he has made has reportedly resulted in advertisers fleeing the company in droves and many doubt that X is worth anywhere near $44 billion now. He's clearly playing the long game though. He has said his aim his for X to be like one of the big Chinese apps which basically does everything.\n\nTwitter is a fascinating example of his core business philosophies at play. He waltzed in there (carrying a sink and tweeting 'Let that sink in') and quickly got to work laying off 75% of staff. Many commentators tweeted and wrote with glee that Twitter would start to fail within days. After all, you can't lay off that amount of staff and still expect the servers to keep running, can you?\n\nAgain, his risk-taking seems to have worked. Twitter stayed up and running.\n\nI've read all kinds of nonsense about how X is now a cesspool because of the lack of moderation. That's not been my experience at all. If anything, it has improved. Whether you agree with him or not, his principle around content moderation has been freedom of speech but not freedom of reach. If you look for objectionable content on X you can find it, but that's it, you have to go looking. I found that my Twitter feed used to be full of angry political content whether I wanted it or not. Today, that's not the case. If you unfollow people who tweet politics, and make it clear to the algorithm that you don't want political content (by flagging users and posts you are not interested in), you won't see it. That's my results at least.\n\nAs soon as Musk took over Twitter there was a mass exodus of users who objected to his politics and the changes he was planning. The result was, for me anyway, it actually made the platform better. Those who left tended to be the opinionated gob-shites who couldn't help themselves to espousing their political views every 5 minutes. I would follow film-critics, business leaders, techies, and others in my areas of interest, but, as they are free to-do, I would also have to hear their latest uninformed opinion on whatever was going on in the political world.\n\nIn truth, I would love it if all the people I follow went over to Mastadon or Bluesky, but it hasn't happened. Social networks are only as good as their content. The network effect means that if, as I do, you want to get the latest and best news of what's happening in Ukraine, X remains the best platform because that's where all the best experts are.\n\nThreads is doing quite well but it's a Meta (Facebook) company and I find it hard to trust Facebook after all their past transgressions.\n\n### X.AI\n\nMusk founded X.AI as a competitor to OpenAI (of which he was a co-founder). He is clearly not happy that OpenAI sold shares to Microsoft and is very bitter about how all that happened.\n\nOpenAI (Chat-GPT) and Google Gemini are dominating the news cycle in terms of AI but I would not being against X.AI in the long term. He has a massive advantage. Hundreds of millions of hours of video content from Tesla cars combined with millions of tweets per hour from X gives him a huge amount of content to train neural networks. The race is on and the more competition the better it is for all of us. At least in Musk's case he is very concerned about AI safety. There's an extremely concerning passage in the book where he talks to Larry Page (Google) about AI safety and Page dismisses the risks, accusing Musk of being a \"specist\" (biased in favour of humans). It is partly this conversation that led Musk to co-found OpenAI, as a counter to Google's dominance.\n\n## Business Learnings\n\nSo what are they key traits and business philosophies of Elon Musk that has led to his success. Here's what I have summarised from the book:\n\n1. **First Principles**\n\nFirst principles thinking means he breaks down complex problems to their most basic components and then builds solutions from scratch. For example, at SpaceX he developed an \"idiot index\" to highlight the ridiculous costs of components. He pressured suppliers into reducing prices by demonstrating how the cost he was paying for raw materials for Tesla parts was substantially cheaper than what was being charged for SpaceX. It seems that using the words Aeronautics or Defence when making purchases is akin to saying the word 'Wedding' at a flower shop. Everything immediately quadruples in price!\n\n2. **Relentless Efficiency**\n\nMusk is obsessed with cost cutting and pays attention to the cost of every part of the process. He challenges every assumption and product specification. If a product spec says that a panel needs 5 rivets, he would get the engineers to test it with 3 rivets and take on the safety risk. At Tesla, he implemented a five-step algorithm for product development that included questioning every requirement, deleting unnecessary parts, simplifying proccesses, accelerating timelines, and only then automating the process.\n\n3. **High Standards**\n\nMusk sets extraordinarily high standards for product quality, obsessing over every detail.

				"content_html": "<p>I was hoping my next blog post would be a bit more positive. In fact, I wasn&rsquo;t even going to write this but I&rsquo;ve now had some time to come to terms with things, so here&rsquo;s where I am.</p>\n<p>Life continues to lay dog turds in my path.</p>\n<p>Things were going well. I was 160 days post transplant and had managed to avoid graft vs host disease or pick up any infections that would require re-admittance to hospital. I was getting out regularly and my fitness was gradually improving. I was even starting to think about when I could return to some kind of work.</p>\n<p>As part of my fitness recovery and our re-introduction to the UK after 17 years in Australia, we had been getting out visiting local towns and cities. In the middle of July we went to Lincoln for the day. I was pleased to discover that unlike a lot of places we&rsquo;ve visited recently (a discussion for another day), Lincoln remains a lovely city to visit.</p>\n<p>I was wondering whether I had recovered enough to tackle Steep Hill - the very steep street that takes you from the river up to the Castle and Cathedral. Well, I managed it. I was knackered by the end of the afternoon but I felt a sense of achievement (probably sounds strange to hear me celebrating managing to walk up Steep Hill - I&rsquo;m 49 not 89!).</p>\n<p>Usually after a day&rsquo;s exertion it takes me a couple of days to recover. This time, we were 4 days later and I was still feeling it. My whole body was aching and I was getting various pains. I knew something wasn&rsquo;t right but just thought it was part of the ups and downs of post-transplant recovery.</p>\n<p>I had also developed a lump on my face above my top lip. It was a hard lump. It didn&rsquo;t hurt, wasn&rsquo;t red or weeping. I didn&rsquo;t think it was enough to warrant another trip back to Sheffield Hospital. I did ring my GP however, who, over the phone, reckoned it was probably just a cyst and I should bring it up at my next visit to Haemotology, which would be the following Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The following Tuesday came and I had had the usual blood tests before my clinic with a consultant from the Haemotology team. As soon as I went in for the clinic the doctor was looking at my blood test results and said &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re in trouble&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>He explained that my white cells had rocketed up and it looks very much like my form of Leukaemia was back. I would need a bone marrow biopsy to confirm but in the meantime I would have to be admitted immediately as there&rsquo;s no time to mess around with this type of thing.</p>\n<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I knew something wasn&rsquo;t right but I never for a second thought I had relapsed. Both Rach and I were in shock.</p>\n<p>The doctor explained that it was actually quite rare to relapse so soon after transplant. Lucky me. He also reminded me that my form of Leukaemia (ALL with Philadelphia B positive) doesn&rsquo;t have a good prognosis. A reality check.</p>\n<p>I was admitted and the next day I had a bone marrow biopsy. They also arranged a biopsy of the lump on my lip. Both confirmed that it was Leukaemia.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bone-marrow-biopsy\">Bone Marrow Biopsy</h2>\n<p>The bone marrow biopsy was horrendous - the worst one yet. They came into my room to do the procedure. Unlike in Australia where it was done under general anaesthetic, this was under local anaesthetic, and even though the doctor had requested it, there was no gas and air.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m glad Rach was in the room to see how horrendous it was. The extraction of the bone marrow from the hip and spine is bad enough but the worst bit is when they have to drill into the bone to take a sample of the actual bone. There&rsquo;s not enough local anaesthetic in the world to dull that pain. The procedure also seemed to last twice as long as the last one in May. The one I had in May was using gas and air, and I think it was the first time that I actually thought gas and air worked. It may have just been the placebo affect but I had somehow mastered it. I think I wasn&rsquo;t taking deep enough inhales before. It was a long time since I&rsquo;d felt this drunk and I was quite enjoying the experience! No such luck this time, I just had to grin and bear it.</p>\n<p>With Leukaemia confirmed, the Haemotology team assessed the next steps. They don&rsquo;t like to arrange another transplant within 12 months, and anyway, the last one had failed, so they needed to look at other options. They explained to me that If this had happened a few years ago I would have been shit out of luck (not quite in those words). Luckily, there&rsquo;s now the option of CAR-T therapy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"car-t-therapy\">CAR-T Therapy</h2>\n<p>Although fairly new as a treatment option, they had been seeing good results from chimeric antigen receptor - T cells (CAR-T) therapy. This is a type of immunotherapy where the T-Cells (blood cells that protect you from infection and disease) are extracted from the patient and genetically modified in a lab to find and kill cancer cells, before infusion back into the blood. In some cases, CAR-T has proved successful when all other treatments have failed.</p>\n<p>In the UK. Leukaemia patients under 25 have been approved for CAR-T therapy. For those over 25, there&rsquo;s a national panel who gets to decide whether the treatment can go ahead. My doctor thought I would be a suitable candidate.</p>\n<p>They quickly got me on the next panel for assessment and thankfully, I was approved.</p>\n<p>I spent two weeks in hospital getting the Leukaemia under control using a combination of steroids, as well as oral and IV chemo. Once my white cells were back down to reasonable levels and other side-effects were under control, I was discharged. I came back on Thursday 8th August as a day patient for the CAR-T extraction (harvesting). Once extracted, the T-cells are sent off to a lab in Amsterdam and it is typically 4 weeks before they are returned for infusion. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m taking daily oral chemo to try and stop the Leukaemia from spreading.</p>\n<p>The CAR-T extraction involved spending 5 hours on a machine called a Blood Cell Separator. A large line is inserted into one arm, the blood goes into the machine where it does its magic before being inserted back into my other arm. Since being admitted to hospital I&rsquo;ve also had another PICC line inserted to take blood and administer IV treatments but they can&rsquo;t use the PICC line for this.</p>\n<p>After the extraction was complete. I then needed a blood transfusion. My haemoglobin levels that day were at dangerously low levels. No wonder I felt like I&rsquo;d been hit by a bus. I would need two bags of blood - both a 2.5 hr infusion. I was a long day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pain\">Pain</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m now waiting for the T-cells to come back from Amsterdam. In the meantime, my days involve trying to keep on top of the pain and dealing with all the side effects of the meds they have me on. The main symptom of Leukaemia for me has been bone pain. I&rsquo;m taking pain relief every 4 hours but it&rsquo;s at night when it&rsquo;s the worst. I seem to be waking up at 1am every morning needing the toilet to find I&rsquo;m in agony.

				"content_text": "I was hoping my next blog post would be a bit more positive. In fact, I wasn't even going to write this but I've now had some time to come to terms with things, so here's where I am.\n\nLife continues to lay dog turds in my path.\n\nThings were going well. I was 160 days post transplant and had managed to avoid graft vs host disease or pick up any infections that would require re-admittance to hospital. I was getting out regularly and my fitness was gradually improving. I was even starting to think about when I could return to some kind of work.\n\nAs part of my fitness recovery and our re-introduction to the UK after 17 years in Australia, we had been getting out visiting local towns and cities. In the middle of July we went to Lincoln for the day. I was pleased to discover that unlike a lot of places we've visited recently (a discussion for another day), Lincoln remains a lovely city to visit.\n\nI was wondering whether I had recovered enough to tackle Steep Hill - the very steep street that takes you from the river up to the Castle and Cathedral. Well, I managed it. I was knackered by the end of the afternoon but I felt a sense of achievement (probably sounds strange to hear me celebrating managing to walk up Steep Hill - I'm 49 not 89!).\n\nUsually after a day's exertion it takes me a couple of days to recover. This time, we were 4 days later and I was still feeling it. My whole body was aching and I was getting various pains. I knew something wasn't right but just thought it was part of the ups and downs of post-transplant recovery.\n\nI had also developed a lump on my face above my top lip. It was a hard lump. It didn't hurt, wasn't red or weeping. I didn't think it was enough to warrant another trip back to Sheffield Hospital. I did ring my GP however, who, over the phone, reckoned it was probably just a cyst and I should bring it up at my next visit to Haemotology, which would be the following Tuesday.\n\nThe following Tuesday came and I had had the usual blood tests before my clinic with a consultant from the Haemotology team. As soon as I went in for the clinic the doctor was looking at my blood test results and said \"I think we're in trouble\".\n\nHe explained that my white cells had rocketed up and it looks very much like my form of Leukaemia was back. I would need a bone marrow biopsy to confirm but in the meantime I would have to be admitted immediately as there's no time to mess around with this type of thing.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I knew something wasn't right but I never for a second thought I had relapsed. Both Rach and I were in shock.\n\nThe doctor explained that it was actually quite rare to relapse so soon after transplant. Lucky me. He also reminded me that my form of Leukaemia (ALL with Philadelphia B positive) doesn't have a good prognosis. A reality check.\n\nI was admitted and the next day I had a bone marrow biopsy. They also arranged a biopsy of the lump on my lip. Both confirmed that it was Leukaemia.\n\n## Bone Marrow Biopsy\n\nThe bone marrow biopsy was horrendous - the worst one yet. They came into my room to do the procedure. Unlike in Australia where it was done under general anaesthetic, this was under local anaesthetic, and even though the doctor had requested it, there was no gas and air.\n\nI'm glad Rach was in the room to see how horrendous it was. The extraction of the bone marrow from the hip and spine is bad enough but the worst bit is when they have to drill into the bone to take a sample of the actual bone. There's not enough local anaesthetic in the world to dull that pain. The procedure also seemed to last twice as long as the last one in May. The one I had in May was using gas and air, and I think it was the first time that I actually thought gas and air worked. It may have just been the placebo affect but I had somehow mastered it. I think I wasn't taking deep enough inhales before. It was a long time since I'd felt this drunk and I was quite enjoying the experience! No such luck this time, I just had to grin and bear it.\n\nWith Leukaemia confirmed, the Haemotology team assessed the next steps. They don't like to arrange another transplant within 12 months, and anyway, the last one had failed, so they needed to look at other options. They explained to me that If this had happened a few years ago I would have been shit out of luck (not quite in those words). Luckily, there's now the option of CAR-T therapy.\n\n## CAR-T Therapy\n\nAlthough fairly new as a treatment option, they had been seeing good results from chimeric antigen receptor - T cells (CAR-T) therapy. This is a type of immunotherapy where the T-Cells (blood cells that protect you from infection and disease) are extracted from the patient and genetically modified in a lab to find and kill cancer cells, before infusion back into the blood. In some cases, CAR-T has proved successful when all other treatments have failed.\n\nIn the UK. Leukaemia patients under 25 have been approved for CAR-T therapy. For those over 25, there's a national panel who gets to decide whether the treatment can go ahead. My doctor thought I would be a suitable candidate.\n\nThey quickly got me on the next panel for assessment and thankfully, I was approved.\n\nI spent two weeks in hospital getting the Leukaemia under control using a combination of steroids, as well as oral and IV chemo. Once my white cells were back down to reasonable levels and other side-effects were under control, I was discharged. I came back on Thursday 8th August as a day patient for the CAR-T extraction (harvesting). Once extracted, the T-cells are sent off to a lab in Amsterdam and it is typically 4 weeks before they are returned for infusion. In the meantime, I'm taking daily oral chemo to try and stop the Leukaemia from spreading.\n\nThe CAR-T extraction involved spending 5 hours on a machine called a Blood Cell Separator. A large line is inserted into one arm, the blood goes into the machine where it does its magic before being inserted back into my other arm. Since being admitted to hospital I've also had another PICC line inserted to take blood and administer IV treatments but they can't use the PICC line for this.\n\nAfter the extraction was complete. I then needed a blood transfusion. My haemoglobin levels that day were at dangerously low levels. No wonder I felt like I'd been hit by a bus. I would need two bags of blood - both a 2.5 hr infusion. I was a long day.\n\n## Pain\nI'm now waiting for the T-cells to come back from Amsterdam. In the meantime, my days involve trying to keep on top of the pain and dealing with all the side effects of the meds they have me on. The main symptom of Leukaemia for me has been bone pain. I'm taking pain relief every 4 hours but it's at night when it's the worst. I seem to be waking up at 1am every morning needing the toilet to find I'm in agony. The pain goes from my back around in to my chest and is that intense that my body seizes up. I have to get Rach to help me out of bed.\n\nThe palliative care team saw me yesterday to talk about the pain and they've modified what I'm on. Let's see if it works. I can't say I'm having much fun at the moment.\n\nA lot of the meds that I'm on make you drowsy. So just staying awake is a constant battle. If I keep busy I seem to be ok, but as soon as I stop and take a break, I'm struggling to keep my eyes open.\n\nThe other problem is that those two weeks in hospital dramatically set back my fitness levels. It's as if the last few months were for nothing. I did a short 1 mile walk last week around a local lake and I thought I was going to have a heart attack at the end of it!\n\nThe doctor explained to me that, just like the stem cell transplant, I need to be in the best state of fitness to give the CAR-T a chance of success. The thing is, the pain at the moment means it's killing me just to get up stairs to my bedroom, never mind anything else.\n\nThe amount of oxy-codeine I'm taking has also bunged me up again. Welcome back, constipation. It really is deja vu.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nSo that's where I am. It's now over a year since I was first diagnosed and things have basically gone back to January. We're hoping the CAR-T is successful. I haven't yet had the guts to ask what happens if it's not a success.\n\nBefore I go back in for CAR-T infusion I will need another bone marrow test, as well as a lumber puncture to deliver chemotherapy to protect the spine and brain. I'm also having other various tests (ECG, lung function, etc), and I need 3 days of conditioning chemotherapy. Luckily this can be administered as a day patient.\n\nAs with the stem cell transplant, even if the CAR-T is a success there are still associated risks. The biggest and most likely risk is something called Cytokine release syndrome. The CAR-T stimulates the immune system to make large amounts of cytokines. This can result in symptoms such as fever, difficulty breathing, headaches, etc, and in the worst case may be require admittance to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

My <a href=\"https://darylhaines.com/2024/02/08/transplant-day-and.html\">last update</a> was the day before transplant day after undergoing a week of conditioning chemo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transplant-day\">Transplant Day</h2>\n<p>I was surprisingly calm the morning of transplant day. I put on my Unwind playlist and listened to some calming music. Rach, Lauren and my parents arrived to be with me for the transplant. It broke the 2 visitors per day rule but nobody batted an eyelid as this was not a normal day.</p>\n<p>The nurse from the transplant team arrived in the afternoon and delivered the special package. The donor had done really well and delivered easily more blood than they needed.</p>\n<p>The bag of blood with the new stem cells was hung up and connected to my central line. It was funny looking. I‚Äôve had plenty of blood transfusions but they were always a bag of deep red blood as you would expect. This bag was murky and orange. The main thing was that it contained 500 million stem cells.</p>\n<p>The infusion took place over a couple of hours and the transplant nurse stayed with me to monitor it for the duration. On one hand it was a simple blood transfusion. On the other hand It was a hugely emotional experience and I was under no misapprehension as to the significance of it. Pretty quickly the grafting process would start and my body would be building a new immune system - using someone else&rsquo;s stem cells. My blood DNA would change. This was a huge milestone and would hopefully seriously reduce the risk of Leukaemia returning, or, my body could fight it and it could be the beginning of serious complications due to host vs graft disease.</p>\n<h2 id=\"post-transplant\">Post-Transplant</h2>\n<p>I was told to expect to spend 4-6 weeks in hospital. My goal was for it to be 4 weeks and not a day longer. Of course, much of this is out of your hands. However, there are things you can do to reduce the chances of it being longer. I was determined to do everything right. I would take all the meds, get the timing right for anti-sickness and pain relief, keep on top of the mouthwashes to reduces the severity of mucusitus, keep clean and try not to stay in bed all day, etc, etc.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm really not sure if any of this made a difference. I‚Äôve had mucusitus with every chemo cycle and the same happened this time. I think I may have delayed it a few days but sure enough, about a week and a half after finishing chemo it quickly set in with a vengeance. I couldn‚Äôt swallow anything. They had to switch my tablets to IV meds and I was on a fluid diet for a week. I also got all the usual chemo side effects - vomiting, fatigue, diarrhoea, etc. Strangely enough, I kind of took this all in my stride. I‚Äôve been dealing with this shit since July so it was nothing new.</p>\n<p>What did give me strength was the daily visits from the consultants who told me I was smashing it. At one point, the consultant told me that at this stage in the cycle most of his patients were crying under a blanket wearing a nappy!</p>\n<p>Inevitably all my hair has dropped out again. It happened about a week later than is usually the case so I thought I‚Äôd got away with it this time. Nope. It was gone in no time.</p>\n<p>I got to week 4 and I became obsessed with my daily blood results. To get out of there my neutrophils count had to be above 1 and I needed to be off IV for any other issues that I was dealing with. I had a few - acute kidney disease because I wasn‚Äôt getting enough fluid, low potassium, magnesium, and other things that would pop up.</p>\n<p>In week 4 they commenced with G-CSF injections to stimulate the production of white blood cells. The side effect of this, which I‚Äôve dealt with before, is severe bone pain. I usually only get it the first couple of nights but this time it lasted 4 days. The second night was the worst, I just couldn‚Äôt get the pain under control. I had a Fentanyl patch on my back and thy were giving me oxy-codone but it wasn‚Äôt enough. I was pacing around my room in agony. Eventually they doubled the dose of painkillers and this did the trick. The next night I made sure I got the painkillers in early in advance of the severe pain - it always seemed to kick in around 11pm.</p>\n<p>The first results came in - Neutraphils at 0.15. It was a start, but it was only 5 days before my goal of getting out of there after exactly 4 weeks. The next day - 0.28. Then the following day - 0.57. Then - 1.1. I had made it. I had also managed to get all the IV stuff switched back to oral tablets. With one day to go, barring some last minute problems, I was on track to be released.</p>\n<h2 id=\"discharge-day\">Discharge Day</h2>\n<p>I was out of there, but, for anyone who has experienced stays in hospital you will know that discharge day is the longest day of the hospital stay. The problem is always pharmacy. It was the same in Australia. They told me to expect to not be discharged until about 6pm. 6pm came and went. I have no idea what happened but I didn‚Äôt get discharged until 1am. It was crazy. My wife was getting increasingly agitated. The nurses on the ward were constantly apologetic but it was completely out of their control. I have no idea what the problem was but it seems to me that pharmacy is completely dysfunctional. Is it lack of staff? Process problems? Who knows. It did take the shine off exit day. By the time we got home in the middle of the night I was exhausted.</p>\n<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter now. Home sweet home.</p>\n<p>I say home sweet home but in truth it‚Äôs probably going to be a while before this seems like home. I only had a few days in our new house before hospital admission, so everything is really new. I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt take long. It is nice to sleep in my own bed and not get woken in the night multiple times for obs.</p>\n<p>As I explained in my previous post, now is the time for home isolation. I have no immune system so it‚Äôs a case of being really, really careful to avoid picking up anything that will lead to me being hospitalised again. Everyone has told me that as careful as I can be it‚Äôs pretty much inevitable that I will end up back in. Nearly everyone who goes through this does - multiple times.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm taking no chances though. If I have any visitors they get temperature checked at the door and need to wear a mask. They know not to visit if there‚Äôs any signs of sickness. If I go out it‚Äôs for fresh air only - a walk in open spaces. I won‚Äôt be going in any shops or restaurants, even with a mask, until I‚Äôm well on the road to recovery.</p>\n",

I also got all the usual chemo side effects - vomiting, fatigue, diarrhoea, etc. Strangely enough, I kind of took this all in my stride. I‚Äôve been dealing with this shit since July so it was nothing new.\n\nWhat did give me strength was the daily visits from the consultants who told me I was smashing it. At one point, the consultant told me that at this stage in the cycle most of his patients were crying under a blanket wearing a nappy!\n\nInevitably all my hair has dropped out again. It happened about a week later than is usually the case so I thought I‚Äôd got away with it this time. Nope. It was gone in no time.\n\nI got to week 4 and I became obsessed with my daily blood results. To get out of there my neutrophils count had to be above 1 and I needed to be off IV for any other issues that I was dealing with. I had a few - acute kidney disease because I wasn‚Äôt getting enough fluid, low potassium, magnesium, and other things that would pop up.\n\nIn week 4 they commenced with G-CSF injections to stimulate the production of white blood cells. The side effect of this, which I‚Äôve dealt with before, is severe bone pain. I usually only get it the first couple of nights but this time it lasted 4 days. The second night was the worst, I just couldn‚Äôt get the pain under control. I had a Fentanyl patch on my back and thy were giving me oxy-codone but it wasn‚Äôt enough. I was pacing around my room in agony. Eventually they doubled the dose of painkillers and this did the trick. The next night I made sure I got the painkillers in early in advance of the severe pain - it always seemed to kick in around 11pm.\n\nThe first results came in - Neutraphils at 0.15. It was a start, but it was only 5 days before my goal of getting out of there after exactly 4 weeks. The next day - 0.28. Then the following day - 0.57. Then - 1.1. I had made it. I had also managed to get all the IV stuff switched back to oral tablets. With one day to go, barring some last minute problems, I was on track to be released.\n\n## Discharge Day\n\nI was out of there, but, for anyone who has experienced stays in hospital you will know that discharge day is the longest day of the hospital stay. The problem is always pharmacy. It was the same in Australia. They told me to expect to not be discharged until about 6pm. 6pm came and went. I have no idea what happened but I didn‚Äôt get discharged until 1am. It was crazy. My wife was getting increasingly agitated. The nurses on the ward were constantly apologetic but it was completely out of their control. I have no idea what the problem was but it seems to me that pharmacy is completely dysfunctional. Is it lack of staff? Process problems? Who knows. It did take the shine off exit day. By the time we got home in the middle of the night I was exhausted.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter now. Home sweet home.\n\nI say home sweet home but in truth it‚Äôs probably going to be a while before this seems like home. I only had a few days in our new house before hospital admission, so everything is really new. I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt take long. It is nice to sleep in my own bed and not get woken in the night multiple times for obs.\n\nAs I explained in my previous post, now is the time for home isolation. I have no immune system so it‚Äôs a case of being really, really careful to avoid picking up anything that will lead to me being hospitalised again. Everyone has told me that as careful as I can be it‚Äôs pretty much inevitable that I will end up back in. Nearly everyone who goes through this does - multiple times.\n\nI‚Äôm taking no chances though. If I have any visitors they get temperature checked at the door and need to wear a mask. They know not to visit if there‚Äôs any signs of sickness. If I go out it‚Äôs for fresh air only - a walk in open spaces. I won‚Äôt be going in any shops or restaurants, even with a mask, until I‚Äôm well on the road to recovery.\n\n",

It&rsquo;s happened before and I wasn&rsquo;t too worried. It took them sometime to get it under control but I&rsquo;m now ok for the final chemo today.</p>\n<p>I also had an x-ray in my left foot. About 3 weeks ago I noticed my left foot had swollen up and become incredibly tender. This week the consultant looked at it and thought it may be gout brought on by all the meds. He got a rheumatologist to look at it, who concurred, but booked me in for an x-ray anyway just to check for other things. Bizarrely, the x-ray revealed a lump of metal in my big toe. How long it‚Äôs been there or how it even got there without me noticing is a mystery. It could be entirely unrelated and the swelling could still be gout. Either way, it‚Äôs too dangerous to cut my toe open now. The metal will have to stay there for the time being. I‚Äôm on meds for gout anyway as part of the conditioning treatment.

Since then, it has continued to be a roller coaster. I ended up having 6 cycles of chemo and spent 5 months in hospital (so far). We made the flights that we originally booked and I&rsquo;m now under the care of the transplant team at Sheffield Hallamshire hospital.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chemo-and-infections\">Chemo and Infections</h2>\n<p>Chemotherapy has been tough. Many of the side effects repeated with each cycle but I did get better at managing them. The protocol for my treatment required two different courses of treatment - A and B. This was repeated 3 times - hence the 6 cycles. A and B had different drugs and I&rsquo;m still trying to make my mind up which was worse. I had a few bad reactions to some of them so they were tweaked as we went along.

I could look out of the window and see our apartment across the road. The doctor could tell it was having an impact on my mental health so had to weigh up the risk of letting me out for a break against the risk of me staying in and turning into a mental wreck. The first two cycles of chemo were back to back. After that, they were happy for me to go home for a 1 week break between cycles. It was never enough. I would be at home in recovery but still having all the side effects - fatigue, nausea and vomiting, etc. I would get to day 6 of being at home and just starting to feel a little better when it was time to go back in again.</p>\n<p>After the first couple of cycles they also gave me a pass to go home mid-cycle for the recovery days with a warning that if I started to get feverish I would need to come back in straight away because even a cold could kill me. They had seen it all before and they were absolutely right. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I would go across the road to my apartment, not leave it, and nearly every time I would pick up an infection. After a few months this was devastating. I&rsquo;d be desperate to get out of hospital (just to get some sleep, if nothing else), and sometimes within hours I would feel myself getting a fever. Rach would take my temperature and as soon as it got close to 38 degrees I&rsquo;d be back in hospital again. I stupidly argued with her - trying to come up with any rationale why it&rsquo;s not really a fever and we should wait a little longer. She rightly was having none of it. So I&rsquo;d go back in and immediately get put on a course of antibiotics.

Since then, it has continued to be a roller coaster. I ended up having 6 cycles of chemo and spent 5 months in hospital (so far). We made the flights that we originally booked and I'm now under the care of the transplant team at Sheffield Hallamshire hospital.\n\n## Chemo and Infections\nChemotherapy has been tough. Many of the side effects repeated with each cycle but I did get better at managing them. The protocol for my treatment required two different courses of treatment - A and B. This was repeated 3 times - hence the 6 cycles. A and B had different drugs and I'm still trying to make my mind up which was worse.

I've been plagued with them over the years and thought they were back. For 2 weeks I'd been suffering back and shoulder pains. At first I thought it was just posture pain from spending too much time at my computer. I was between contracts and using the time to make as much progress as possible on the app I've been developing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was a Friday and Rach convinced me to go to Costco with her and Lauren. I'd never been and she promised it would be an experience (lol), and I really needed to get out the apartment. I made it about halfway round before I thought I was going to pass out. It was still the next day before I went to the hospital. Blokes are generally terrible for seeking medical help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next day Rach and Lauren were out at Woolworths and I was in agony so I finally succumbed and walked over to the hospital. Luckily, we live directly opposite an hospital - which has turned out to be very handy indeed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I got triaged by the nurse before being sent for a CT scan and bloods. The CT scan revealed that I had mild pancreatitis, which was a surprise. The bigger surprise was to come from the blood tests.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A while later I was visited by Dr Shanavas, a haematologist. He would go on to become my main treating doctor. He told me that my white blood count was raised, I think 3 times above normal levels. Rach caught on straight away. I was a bit slower to catch on. I may know a lot about cybersecurity but my medical knowledge is severely lacking - at least it was at that point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>More tests were needed. The next day he returned to say that count had doubled overnight. Tests were pointing to acute Leukaemia. I would need a bone marrow biopsy tomorrow to confirm the exact type.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He explained the next steps. I would start on chemotherapy straight away. If it's the Leukaemia type he expected I would likely need at least four cycles of chemotherapy before being put forward for a bone marrow transplant. The first point of call for the transplant is my brother. There would be a 30% chance that he's a match. If no match then they go to the general donor register. That has a 70% chance of a match. Last resort would be my daughter Lauren. I really hope it doesn't come to that. He explained that it's a long process and even if all goes well I'd be looking at being out of work for a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Things started to finally sink in. I got upset, but strangely the stuff that was racing through my head was not concerns over my health, but worries about the financial situation and a feeling of utter stupidity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had given up my permanent job at Telstra in December to go contracting under my own business. Contracting can be lucrative but there's no sick pay, holidays, etc. If you don't work, you don't earn. I had finished one 6 month contract but had already been out of work for about 6 weeks when I got the diagnosis. We have savings but we also have expenses - most notably an expensive riverside apartment. A rent of $900 a week was fine when I was earning good money. Now we would be reliant upon Rach's income, and she was part-time. Not only that, when I left Telstra I moved my superannuation to the new Vanguard fund. I'd been put on the base level of income protection and life insurance and not yet got around to increasing it. I felt like an idiot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Those first few days were a rollercoaster. The next day I had the bone marrow biopsy and started chemo. The bone marrow test confirmed I have Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia with Philadelphia positive (ALL-B+). Besides knowing that Leukaemia is a blood cancer I was utterly clueless at this time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The white cell count had doubled again. Dr. Shanavas explained that if I hadn't come into hospital when I did I would have been dead within 3 weeks. That concentrated the mind. Never again will I just put up with the pain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Private Medical Insurance</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In Australia, a single person earning over $93,000 or a family with income over $186,000 gets hit with an extra tax - the Medicare Surcharge Levy. This can be avoided if you have private hospital cover from an approved insurance provider. The idea is to encourage those who can afford it get to get private cover to take the strain off the public system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Until now, I've had private hospital cover for years and never made use of it to check in to a private hospital. I also never bothered getting the additional Extras cover for dental, physio, etc as i ran the numbers and it never made financial sense.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Coming from the UK with the NHS, for a long time I was reticent about the Australian system. The two-tier system just felt wrong. Yet another thing where money talks. I was of the opinion that quality healthcare and education should be available to everyone, irrespective of ability to pay.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My view has now become a bit more pragmatic. Especially when looking at wait times on the NHS. As egalitarian as the UK system is, I really believe that it's unsustainable in the long term.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Up until now (mainly for my kidney stones treatment), I had checked into a public hospital and let the public hospital claim on my private cover. A bit worthy I know but I never gave it much thought.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This time I'm in a private hospital and extremely grateful that I am.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first got admitted I was put in a shared room with one other. A bit later I was moved to another shared room. In both cases I was sharing with old deaf men who insisted on having their TV on at the loudest setting 24hrs a day. Luckily I eventually got moved to a private room to start my chemo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chemotherapy</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I could probably do a longer post just on chemo. Talk about a rollercoaster. Every day is different and you just don't know what to expect (at least during the initial cycles). The thing about chemo is that it does a great job of killing the cancer cells, but it also kills a lot of cells that you need, particularly in the gut lining, the mouth and hair follicles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The chemo protocol is different each day and has involved a bunch of drugs I had never heard of - Cytarabina, Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Cyclophosphomide, etc. All of which have their own side-effects. Most of these are administered via IV. Some are oral tablets. Twice each cycle I also have to go for a lumber puncture to deliver one of the chemo drugs to protect the brain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As well as the chemo I've been administered heavy doses of the steroid dexamethasone. If anything, the side-effect of this were just had bad as some of the chemo drugs, particularly in the first cycle. I was told that It would make me hypersensitive and would affect sleep. Yes and more. It sent me a bit loopy. The worst day was when I had short-term memory loss. The confusion was one of the scariest things I've ever experienced. I now have a bit of knowledge about what it must be like for dementia sufferers. I really hope I never get dementia.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The physical pain can be handled. When I need it, I get Panadol, Endone, and one time I even had Fentanyl. I was a bit reluctant to have this after visiting San Francisco and Vancouver and seeing first-hand the utter destruction Fentanyl addiction is causing. The staff assured me that in hospital it's strictly controlled and I don't have to worry about addiction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The mental effects though are something that you just have to take. There is no drug you can take. You just have to hope it's temporary and will pass. Luckily it did and so far I haven't experienced anything like what I went through in cycle 1.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the worst side-effects from chemo has been Mucositis. Each cycle this has manifested after a few days. It starts with a sore throat and before long it's extremely painful to swallow. Given the amount of drugs I have to to take orally each day to counter the chemo, this in itself is an ordeal. The soft food diet has resulted in me losing 14kg of weight so far. I'm sure its not all down to the Mucositis. Some of this is muscle loss from spending 8 weeks in hospital. I'm following a physio plan but there's many days when the chemo means it's a struggle just to get out of bed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Code Blue</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had a full body P.E.T scan to discover if there were any other cancers lurking. The scan found a lesion on my colon. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had a colonoscopy, which luckily found that it was just a polyp. They removed the polyp but I ended up with some significant bleeding. The next day I had a further colonoscopy where they proudly proclaimed they had fixed the bleeding. They hadn't.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That evening, after sitting on the toilet for perhaps the seventh time, I suddenly new I was about to faint. I managed to hit the call button before I passed out. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I awoke to mayhem. I was flat out on the floor of the bathroom. There were perhaps 8 people in my room all looking worried. Alarms going off everywhere. I found out later that I was found unresponsive and they called a code blue. They even gave me chest compressions. My initial reaction was bemusement. I kept telling them that I felt fine but they were taking it extremely serious. To the point where all the staff on the ward kept mentioning the scare for days later.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Luckily the bleeding cleared up after a couple of days.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sleep, or Lack Thereof</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tiredness and sleep is a perennial problem. You would think that spending all this time in hospital with nothing to do would mean I would have plenty of time to watch movies and read books. Not so. On chemo days the mental clarity is really a problem. I could only look at a screen for about 30 mins before I lose focus. It was certainly like that in the first few weeks. It's getting better now - to the point where I'm able to spend a few hours each day working on my app. More on the app another time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sleep is a real problem. I'm hooked up to the IV stack via a PICC line in my arm for most hours during the day. The PICC line is a thin wire inserted into a vein in my arm that comes out to 3 separate lumens. This allows multiple drugs to be administered at once while also being able to retrieve blood. I have to have daily blood tests - for some reason they insist on doing this at 4am. When I had the PICC inserted they said some patients have it in for 8 months. I'm on my 3rd PICC already. After a couple of weeks the nurses have problems extracting blood. I don't know whether this is a particular problem with my compatibility or they're just not flushing the lumens properly. What this means is that once they fail to take blood they call for the vampires in Pathology to take peripherals (i.e stick me in the other arm). After a while the other arm becomes like a pin cushion and extremely soar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The IV alarms are constantly going off - end of infusion, upstream collusion, downstream collusion, air bubble (that one's a bit scary). I swear to god I'll be hearing those alarms in my sleep for years to come. Then there's the general hospital noise 24/7. Even though I'm in a private room the walls are very thin. I can hear the same alarms going off throughout the ward and often the nurses choose my room to stand outside at 3am and have chat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the end of each cycle I have a bone marrow biopsy to test the results of the chemo. This one's a bit of an ordeal the day of two after. It results in joint stiffening and pain all over.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Luckily, after the first cycle I received the fantastic news that I was in remission. Not only that - deep remission. This meant that I have something like a less than 0.001 chance of recurrence. That doesn't mean the chemo stops. I still need to do at least four cycles and have the transplant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the end of first cycle they let me out for a weekend pass. At the end of the second cycle they let me out for a full 6 days. Bliss. To sleep in my own bed and not get interrupted, and eat something different to hospital food.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bugs</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have picked up two blood infections since being in hospital. One has been treated. The other is a Carbapenem-resistant&nbsp;<em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>&nbsp;(CRE) superbug. This can't be treated with antibiotics and I just have to live with it. It's not really a problem for me. The problem is for other patient. What this means is that I'm on permanent contact precautions while in hospital. I have to have my own room and any staff entering the room have to rig up with gloves and protective clothing so they don't pass it on to other patients. It's a pain in the arse for them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plans</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before getting the diagnosis we had already planned to return to the UK. Lauren graduates from University in December and is planning on backpacking around Europe for a while. We've now lived in Australia for 16 years and are ready for a change. The COVID lockdown experience made us realise how isolated were are out here. Also, priorities shift the older you get. We came here for the lifestyle, but the longer we've been away the more we have missed friends and family, and everything that the UK and the proximity to Europe offers. We're also completely over the Brisbane heat and humidity. The plan was to go and live in London for a year. We love London and luckily with my career it shouldn't be that difficult to pick up work. Obviously that's out of the window now. Rental costs and not being able to work makes it a non-starter. There's also the question of family support. Rach will not be able to work for 3 months after transplant to be my carer. Any extra family support (for Rach) will be particularly welcome.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Flights were booked before I got diagnosed. We haven't cancelled them. My chemo should finish around about mid-October. It now all depends on the transplant. Our Dr has sent an email to the transplant team at Sheffield Royal Hallamshire to make contact. If all goes well we're hoping to get a transfer to Sheffield for the transplant. Timing is an issue though. Apparently they don't like a gap of more than one month between chemo and transplant. This probably means that I either have to continue further chemo here right up until December, or I fly back early and miss Lauren's graduation. Both scenarios are not ideal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We will then need to look for a place to rent. We're thinking at the moment it will probably be somewhere back near family in Worksop, not too far from Sheffield. Rent is less than half what it would be in London. Luckily we have enough savings to cover the year out of work. It's a shame we have to use it but I guess that's what savings are for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Feeling Grateful</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm grateful for my care team. Besides the nurses, who really are angels (I couldn't do that job), I have Dr. Shanavas who is a bona-fide expert and seems to be able to accurately predict to the day what side effects I will get, and importantly, when they will end. I also have other experts that regularly visit me to check on my liver, diet, physio and other aspects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most importantly, I'm grateful for Rachelle and Lauren. Rach managed to pick up extra hours at work while still allowing a late start and early finish to visit me in hospital. Even though we only live across the road Rach insists on being here all the time. I keep telling her to go home but she wants to be here with me. I know it's taking its toll. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, I'm tired now and returning to my sick bed. More later. Hopefully it's not another 4 years again before I post another blog post!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ce8dbf5987.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After moving in the to city from the suburbs I‚Äôve seriously embraced city living, to the point where I‚Äôve even been using the <a href=\"https://www.li.me\">Lime Scooters</a>. Brisbane is conducting a trial of electric scooters and there are 500 of them randomly scattered in and around the CBD. A 43 year old man on an electric scooter. It‚Äôs a good look. Honest.</p>\n<p>The scooters are a fabulous idea but I worry that the scooter wankers out there are going to ruin it for the rest of us. As is usually the case.</p>\n<p>The problem appears to be two-fold. The first issue is that Queensland law means that you must wear a helmet, but people keep nicking the helmets. Finding a scooter with an attached helmet is completely pot-luck. The other problem is that scooter wankers <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-30/electric-scooters-riders-fined-safety-breaches-brisbane-qld/10956110\">are getting pissed up and riding them on their way back from a night out</a>, scaring the shit out of pedestrians with their antics.</p>\n<p>Queensland Police have announced that they are <a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/police-launch-taskforce-to-target-stupid-e-scooter-riders-20190330-p5196y.html\">setting up a task force to catch the scooter wankers</a>, which is fair enough. </p>\n<p>Where to begin with this? </p>\n<p>I made the mistake of looking at the comments on social media in response to the articles. The consensus seems to be mass hysteria about the inevitable deaths that will occur.</p>\n<p>This is the problem. We can‚Äôt have nice things. A few wankers piss people off, causing people to make a mountain out of a molehill. They moan like hell on social media, so of course, local news picks up on it and hype it up even further.</p>\n<p>Both problems are genuine concerns, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that they should be banned. Why is the immediate answer to ban everything?</p>\n<p>With regards to helmets, one of two things need to happen. Either the Queensland Parliament need to relax the laws on helmets - perhaps accepting that an adult riding a scooter 6 inches off the ground is not the same as a child on a bicycle, or, the scooter operators need to come up with a technical solution to stop the helmets going walkabout. This will inevitably cost money and might make the whole enterprise non-viable. I have no idea, but let‚Äôs at least explore the options.</p>\n<p>As for the scooter wankers, let‚Äôs see what happens. The whole experience is relatively new for the streets of Brisbane, so there will be many unfamiliar with the legislation, and many others who just see it as a novelty that might not last. Hopefully the safety campaign has an effect.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>My thoughts on today‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2019/\">Apple Special Event</a> covering the new services...</p>\n<h2 id=\"apple-tv-and-apple-tv-\">Apple TV and Apple TV+</h2>\n<p>All the press before the event speculated on Apple launching a Netflix-killing TV service. Well, let‚Äôs wait and see. Judging by the fact that they didn‚Äôt even play a single trailer for a show, they‚Äôre clearly a long way from being ready. When they do launch later this year there will be perhaps 20-30 original productions. A good start, but they‚Äôve got a lot of catching up to do to begin challenging Netflix, and there was no mention of which other studios will be including content within the + service.</p>\n<p>They did say that we will be able to purchase separate subscriptions to HBO, Showtime, etc. Oh joy, yet more subscriptions. TV is becoming that fragmented it‚Äôs getting to the point that it makes sense to go back to Cable/Satellite TV again.</p>\n<p>The TV app on iOS and Apple TV leaves a lot to be desired. There wasn‚Äôt much mention of new features or interface changes, but then that‚Äôs a software thing, not services. Hopefully we‚Äôll hear about some significant improvements at WWDC in June.</p>\n<p>The main problems I currently have with the TV app are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of support for multiple profiles</li>\n<li>No separate Watch List, just the ability to add shows to Up Next, and no abillity to change the order of shows in Up Next.</li>\n<li>A lack of integration with Netflix and Stan. Netflix integration will likely never happen from what I‚Äôve read.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that the TV app is now coming to Smart TVs and even Roku, I hope that doesn‚Äôt signal the end of the Apple TV. For those of us who still play content from a large iTunes library running from a home media server, Apple TV for me is still the best way to watch that content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apple-arcade\">Apple Arcade</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôm not sure I will subscribe to Apple Arcade. I&#039;m not much of a gamer. It does look an interesting proposition though. I wonder in the long run how the exclusivity agreement will play out with developers? Will the revenue they get from Apple Arcade make up for the potential loss of revenue from not being able to launch on Android?</p>\n<h2 id=\"apple-news-\">Apple News +</h2>\n<p>It will be interesting to see which publishers are on board when the Apple News  + subscription reaches Australia later in the year.</p>\n<p>In the US, 200 magazines is not particularly a lot, and Apple must be severely disappointed to only have two newspapers sign up on launch. </p>\n<p>As with the TV app, I hope we‚Äôll see some improvements to the News app beyond just support for the magazine design they showed in the keynote. At the moment I still prefer <a href=\"https://flipboard.com\">Flipboard</a> to consume news. It‚Äôs a simple thing but I love the animation of flipping between articles. I also like the fact you can add any RSS to Flipboard - Apple requires publishers to optimise content fo the Apple News app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apple-card\">Apple Card</h2>\n<p>I hope the Apple Card comes to Australia. It&#039;s very hard to find a credit card in Australia that has no fees (including no international transaction fees), is a reward card, and supports Apple Pay. </p>\n<p>Apple marketed the Apple Card has having a low interest rate. When you look into it that low interest rate in the US is between 13% and 24% dependent upon credit worthiness. Low interest rate my arse. Of course, it‚Äôs not an issue if you pay off your balance every month.</p>\n<p>With no fees, 2% cash back (3% on purchases of Apple stuff), and the ability to use it pretty much everywhere in Australia (where there‚Äôs a 99% contactless adoption rate), I could see it becoming my main card, if, and it‚Äôs a big if, we get the same deal in Australia. </p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a shame they‚Äôve partnered with Goldman Sachs. After the 2008 GFC, Goldman Sachs should be liquidated and their Directors in jail.</p>\n",

It‚Äôs essentially the podcast version of the BBC Radio Five Live Afternoon Edition show. When I started listening it was hosted by Simon Mayo. Then Richard Bacon took over for a few years. He eventually left for some gig in the US and then Dan Walker and Sarah Brett hosted for a short while. Now it‚Äôs hosted by Nihal Arthanayake. This is one of those where I just listen to the episodes depending on who‚Äôs being interviewed. </p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not too keen on the latest host to be honest. A little too sycophantic to his guest for my liking. A little too keen to be pals with the guests and make them laugh. Although, to give him credit, his interviewing has improved over the last year. He‚Äôs no Simon Mayo though. Too many interviewers try and make the interview about them. Simon Mayo positively shies away from that.</p>\n<p>Another interview-based podcast that is worth a listen - <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/381444908/fresh-air\">Fresh Air (NPR)</a>.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrvln/episodes/downloads\" title=\"Headliners Podcast\">Listen to the Headliners Podcast</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"desert-island-discs-bbc-\">Desert Island Discs (BBC)</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/62cee8ff11.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding:0 30px 0 0;\" alt=\"‚ÄúDesert\">\nSurely this is on everyone‚Äôs list?

				"content_text": "<p>Today is the 15th March - The Ides of March. </p>\n<p>It became significant as the date of the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. </p>\n<p>For World War II buffs, it‚Äôs also significant as a fateful day for Europe. On this day in 1939 Hitler‚Äôs troops began the occupation of the rest of Czechoslovakia, ending the pretence of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement\">Munich Agreement</a>. Nazi Germany had annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia the previous October and promised the Western Powers that this would be the last of his territorial demands. They fell for it.</p>\n<p>It could be said that this was the beginning of the end for Hitler. From this point forward the road to war was inevitable. German troops marched in from the west and Hungarian troops moved into Ruthenia from the east. By the end of the day Czechoslovakia ceased to exist as a sovereign state.</p>\n<p>Neither Britain nor France made the slightest move to intervene, even though at Munich they had provided Czechoslovakia with a guarantee against aggression.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs interesting reading about this period, and particularly the response in Britain. Not long before, Britain‚Äôs Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had been lauded as a peacemaker. The Times and Daily Mail newspapers in particular had shown admiration for Hitler. Even after the 15th March the Daily Mail took its time to renounce Hitler. Of course, Winston Churchill new better.</p>\n",

				"title": "A Year with the Apple HomePod",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9b7e998dbe.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n<p>When Apple finally released the HomePod on the 9th Feb 2018 it didn‚Äôt take me long to buy one. I had looked at the Google Home and Amazon Echo with curiosity, but was never really tempted. I‚Äôm an Apple Music subscriber for one, and I was also reluctant to put an Amazon or Google listening device in my home. I‚Äôve got serious concerns over privacy, and it‚Äôs only Apple that have been able to allay those concerns. That‚Äôs not my inner Apple fanboy talking, I‚Äôve read Apple‚Äôs support papers on privacy and security. </p>\n<p>Prior to the HomePod, I had been using a Sonos Play:1. The Sonos audio quality is generally good, but every now and again there‚Äôs a notable distortion. Only on songs with strong levels of bass, but it happens even when the volume is at mid-levels. The other problem I have with the Sonos is the integration with Apple Music, namely the lack of support for Smart Playlists. I use Smart Playlists extensively within iTunes and to get around the lack of support in Sonos I‚Äôve had to periodically manually copy songs from my smart playlist to dedicated manual playlists for the Sonos. Not ideal. The Sonos has now been relegated to the bedroom. I appreciate my Sonos Play:1 is pretty old now so many of the issues have probably been resolved with newer versions. I believe you can even integrate the new Sonos smart speakers with Siri.</p>\n<p>After using the HomePod for a full year my thoughts are pretty much the same as they were after the first month of use. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-basics\">The Basics</h2>\n<p>First of all, the sound quality is excellent. You don‚Äôt need to be an audiophile to tell this delivers crisp, clear sound at an amazing volume for such a small unit.</p>\n<p>Second, the microphones are unbelievable. For Siri to hear my commands when I‚Äôm speaking at normal volume and music is booming out is quite frankly, witchcraft.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smart-speaker\">Smart Speaker</h2>\n<p>A lot has been written about the smart speaker capability, particularly in comparison to the Google Assistant on the Google Home and Alexa on the Amazon Echo. It‚Äôs true that Siri is not leading the way in this regard. I find that Siri does the job, most of the time, and it is slowly getting better.</p>\n<p>To be frank, all the virtual assistants are shit. All of them have problems with understanding context. It‚Äôs early days and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre going to see amazing leaps in AI over the next few years, but at the moment we‚Äôre a long way from the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/\">Her</a> days. </p>\n<p>The technorati on blogs and YouTube get hung up with smart speaker comparisons. In reality, is the average joe even using voice commands on a regular basis? Let‚Äôs face it, talking to an inanimate object feels weird.</p>\n<p>Still, I can say ‚ÄúHey Sir, play me something I like‚Äù, and pretty much without fail, music that I like starts playing. It helps that over the years I‚Äôve obsessively rated thousands of songs in my iTunes library. At first I thought that Siri was just selecting music from my library that I‚Äôve given a a high rating. That is the case, but it‚Äôs also mixed with songs that i know aren‚Äôt in my library, and seems to match my tastes quite well.</p>\n<p>The only caveat to that is that I don‚Äôt live on my own and the music tastes of my wife and daughter also get factored in. At the moment there‚Äôs no way to use multiple accounts with the HomePod. Apple have said that will come, but for now Rach and Lauren can play music, and the music they select influences Siri‚Äôs learning. You can turn it off in settings. In fact, I probably should turn it off - that should stop Dolly Parton songs interrupting my music sessions!</p>\n<h2 id=\"podcasts\">Podcasts</h2>\n<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts and for some reason I couldn‚Äôt get my podcasts to play on the HomePod. If I asked Siri to play a specific podcast, it would play. If I asked Siri to play my most recent podcast, Siri would tell me ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not subscribed to any podcasts‚Äù. I am. It drove me insane. I subscribe to shit loads of podcasts. I listen to podcasts pretty much every day. </p>\n<p>I‚Äôm guessing the issue has something to do with the fact I have seperate Apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes content. It‚Äôs an issue that goes back to the days of MobileMe. For some reason we had to create a new account for MobileMe and couldn‚Äôt use our existing iTunes ID. Eventually, MobileMe got replaced by iCloud and even though Apple has hinted in the past that they‚Äôre working on a fix to allow customers to merge Apple IDs, it‚Äôs now 2019 and that fix is nowhere in sight. </p>\n<p>Setting up the HomePod was a breeze. You just hold up your iPhone close to the HomePod and it automatically transfers all the settings over. This is the crux of the problem I reckon. I think it was trying to use my iCloud account for podcasts even though on my iPhone I‚Äôm signed in with my other Apple ID for iTunes.</p>\n<p>You may notice I‚Äôm using the past tense. I gave up on the Apple Podcasts app and now use Overcast. I finally gave up with Apple Podcasts when the Apple Podcasts integration on the Apple Watch with iOS 12 failed to meet expectations. That‚Äôs another rant for another day.</p>\n<p>For now, if I want to play a podcast on my HomePod I just Airplay it. So old school I know!</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôm happy with the HomePod and considering buying another one to try out stereo sound with the Apple TV. We‚Äôve recently moved to a new apartment with stone tiled floors, so the acoustics are pretty terrible when watching TV using the in-built TV speakers. The HomePod sound seems to compensate for the acoustics in a way that is much more noticeable than I remember at our old place. Stereo HomePods could be the (pricy) answer. Alternatively, I might try a Soundbar. I hear the Sonos playbar is quite good!</p>\n",

Man Utd fans will pick Scholes. Chelsea fans will pick Lampard and Liverpool fans will say Steven Gerrard. Neutrals will vary between the three and the argument will go on and on in the pub and between the pundits on TV for years.</p>\n<p>As a Liverpool fan I‚Äôm going to say Gerrard, of course I am, but I honestly believe there‚Äôs no contest.</p>\n<p>Don‚Äôt take my word for it. Ask Peter Crouch, who's played with just about everyone. Crouchy devotes a whole chapter to Steven Gerrard in his recent book ‚ÄòHow to be a Footballer‚Äô. Here‚Äôs what he had to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the skills Gerrard had! People would say to me, Xabi Alonso is the best passer of a football I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôd say, yeah, but Stevie is better. They‚Äôd tell me that Claude Mak√©l√©l√© was the best tackler. Yeah, but Stevie‚Äôs better. Lampard is the best goal-scoring midfielder. Yup, Stevie‚Äôs on a par with him. He could play right-back and left-back. He could play centre midfield, he could play off the striker. He could play centre-forward and he could dominate totally from right midfield. It‚Äôs only when you train with a player that you realise quite how good they are. On match-day you would see Thierry Henry and Gianfranco Zola producing little miracles. With Gerrard they were a daily occurrence. He was by far the best player in England training, and that includes David Beckham, Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen. I never trained with Paul Scholes; our times in the national set-up did not overlap. But the Chelsea lads would say the same thing: Gerrard is the most naturally gifted player we‚Äôve worked with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The documentary <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9206562/\">Make Us Dream</a> (available on Amazon Prime) about Stevie‚Äôs career is good, but it doesn‚Äôt really cover anything new. </p>\n<p>If like me, you‚Äôve read his two autobiographies, watched the documentary about him when he released his first autobiography, and the many since that have been on LFC TV, and also watched countless highlights packages on YouTube put together by fans, you will be familiar with the script. </p>\n<p>The standard highlights and lowlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banging goals in from 30 yards</li>\n<li>Tough tackling</li>\n<li>The great goals against Manchester United</li>\n<li>That goal against Olympiakos that meant Liverpool qualified out of the group stage of the Champions League (the year they won it)</li>\n<li>That goal in the Champions League final that inspired the famous comeback</li>\n<li>Signing for Chelsea, and then not signing for Chelsea</li>\n<li>The FA Cup Final screamer against West Ham</li>\n<li>'We Go Again‚Äô at the end of the game where Liverpool beat Manchester City near the end of the 2013/14 season when we were challenging for the title</li>\n<li>That slip against Chelsea two games later that led to Liverpool conceding a goal (people forget that Liverpool lost that game 0-2, not 0-1).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What all these compilations of Stevie‚Äôs career miss, and what‚Äôs hard to purvey unless you‚Äôve sat and watched every game, is the sheer number of games when he carried Liverpool. All those seasons when we just qualified for the Champions League, or managed to win a trophy even though we were nowhere to be seen in the Premier League title race, it was Stevie who made the difference more times than not. He was a playmaker and a match winner. He drove the side forward. He brought the game to life when we were struggling. He kept us in games we seemed destined to lose. Owen, Torres, Suarez - all fantastic strikers during the Gerrard era - and all say that they wouldn‚Äôt have scored so many goals without Stevie offering the supply.</p>\n<p>We now watch from a distance to see how his new career pans out as a manager at Rangers. Waiting, and hoping, for that day in a few years, after Klopp has finally ended the Premier League drought and built a new dynasty, when Stevie takes the reins as Liverpool manager.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The continuing decline of the Royal Navy is a travesty. Today, it'a a shadow of its former self.</p>\n<p>When I joined the RN in 1991, the numbers, both in ships and manpower, were on the decline. This was expected. The cold war had just ended, Saddam Hussein was under containment after his adventure into Kuwait, and there were no major threats on the horizon. We didn't know it at the the time but we were entering a decade of relative peace.</p>\n<p>Despite the relative peace of the 90s, the RN was stretched. Playing a leading role behind the US, we had commitments across the globe. Constant NATO operations between alliance navies, the Armilla Patrols in the Persian Gulf, anti-drug operations in the Caribbean and elsewhere, UN resolution enforcement in the Adriatic Sea during the Bosnian and Kosovo conflicts, UK maritime protection, as well as protection of UK overseas dependancies such as Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. If that wasn't enough, there were the constant 'flag-waving' visits supporting Britain's efforts to bolster international trade all over the world. </p>\n<p>Then 9/11 happened and it changed everything, except, the RN continued to decline.</p>\n<img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9bd19a00d1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"442\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>In 1982, when Margaret Thatcher gave the order to liberate the Falkland Islands, the RN was able to put together a task force of 115 ships. This included two aircraft carriers (HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible) with a full complement of fighter jets, and 23 destroyers and frigates.</p>\n\n<p>During the 90's, we maintained three aircraft carriers - HMS Ark Royal, HMS Invincible and HMS Illustrious, which took turns in operational deployments so we always had at least one flagship carrier at sea, and often two. I was on HMS Invincible for 3 years. </p>\n\n<p>Later, HMS Ocean joined the fleet as our largest amphibious assault ship - capable of carrying up to 18 helicopters and 800 marines for landing operations.  </p>\n\n<p>Compare that with today. The continued budgets cuts under both Labour and Conservative governments has decimated the RN, at a time when commitments have only increased. </p>\n\n<p>HMS Invincible was decommissioned in 2005, followed by HMS Ark Royal in 2011, and HMS Illustrious in 2014. Their replacements, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, are much bigger and more capable ships, but they are not due to be operational until 2020 and 2023 respectively.</p>\n\n<p>So at the moment we have HMS Ocean as the flagship and even she is now going to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-34909649\">decommissioned in 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In total, we are now down to 77 commissioned ships, but that doesn't tell the whole store. The 77 includes:\n   - HMS Ocean (LPD)\n   - 6 destroyers\n   - 13 frigates\n   - 4 ballistic nuclear submarines\n   - 7 attack submarines\n   - 2 assault ships\n   - 15 minesweepers\n   - 22 patrol vessels\n   - 4 survey vessels\n   - 1 icebreaker\n   - 2 historic warships (HMS Victory and HMS Bristol).</p>\n\n<p>Roughly half of the ships are in routine maintenance, refit or sea acceptance training at any given time, and manpower shortages means the Navy is constantly under stress. 9-month long deployments are now becoming the norm, and it's largely believed that the decision to axe HMS Ocean is as a direct result of the need to provide sailors to man HMS Queen Elizabeth.</p>\n\n<p>The UK defence budget in total has declined from over 4% of GDP in 1990 down to 2% today (the NATO minimum). In terms of manpower, the RN is down to just 30,000, compared to 39,000 in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>The government has finally admitted that the continued cuts under the Strategic Defence Reviews (SDR) means Britain can't keep its commitments, and has begun quietly withdrawing from the world. </p>\n\n<p>The RN was playing a leading roll in combating piracy off Somalia and the wider East African coast. That ended in 2012 when the government withdrew the permanent role. Then, this year, after a continued 34 years of presence in the South Atlantic, the RN no longer has a permanent warship patrolling the Falkland Islands to deter Argentinian aggression.</p>\n\n<p>The loss of sea-borne air power has also been an embarrassment for the Government. Shortly after the Sea Harrier squadrons were retired in 2010, the UK launched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ellamy\">Operation Ellamy</a> in 2011 to participate in the military intervention in Libya. We then had one aircraft carrier (HMS Illustrious) with no combat jets, so had to rely on the RAF flying Typhoons and Tornados out of Gioia del Colle in Italy and RAF bases at home.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after, Islamic State fighters started sweeping through northwestern Iraq. The US and French navies deployed aircraft carriers to launch air strikes and the Royal Navy had nothing to offer. </p>\n\n<p>When questioned about the continued cuts the government points to the ship-building programs underway. Again, this tells its own story. The 12 Type-42 destroyers are being replaced with just 6 Type 45s (the programme is already delayed and will not be completed until the mid 2020s). The 12 Swiftsure and Trafalgar class submarines are being replaced with just seven new Astute class subs. The 13 Type-23 frigates are being replaced by 8 Type-26 Global Combat Ships and 5 (for now) type 31s, but there are concerns that lighter Type-31 General Purpose Frigates (GPFF) may not be able to offer the same level of protection.</p>\n\n<p>As for the the new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, they will surely be the pride of the Royal Navy. These are huge 70,000-ton carriers, second only in size to the US Nimitz-class super-carriers. As a comparison, HMS Invincible only displaced 20,000 tons. </p>\n\n<p>However, whether the F35B Joint Striker Fighter will be ready for deployment on HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2020 is still doubtful given the continued, well documented <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/26/most-expensive-weapon-ever-built-limps-toward-finish-line.html\">problems with the most expensive weapons system every built</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, aircraft carriers need escorts and support vessels to form the carrier battle group. An aircraft carrier on its own can't sustain itself for very long and has limited means to defend itself. With the surface combat fleet now numbering only 19 (frigates and destroyers), and with usually only a third on active operations at any one time, HMS Queen Elizabeth is going to monopolise most of the fleet.</p>\n\n<p>All in all it's a sad situation and begs the question what role Britain wants to play, and is capable of playing, under its responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, particularly with post-BREXIT uncertainty causing the pound to plummet and risk the return to strong economic growth.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.savetheroyalnavy.org\">Save the Royal Navy</a>.</p><p>Header image attribution: BAE Systems -¬†<a href=\"http://www.defenceimages.mod.uk/\">www.defenceimages.mod.uk</a></p>\n",

A few people remarked that only the English would holiday to Victoria in the middle of winter. While half of Melbourne flocked to Queensland to chase the sun, we headed the in the opposite direction! The <a href=\"http://visit12apostles.com.au/natural-wonders/\">Twelve Apostles</a>¬†are a collection of limestone stacks off the coast of Port Campbell National Park in Victoria. They're called the Twelve Apostles but in reality there are only eight left.

Now this was tranquil! What you can't see is that above where I was standing is a chair lift that you can take across the gorge. Unfortunately it stops running at 5:30pm so I missed it. On one side of the basin there's some beautiful botanical gardens, and on the other side there's a huge public swimming pool and Cafe. If this were anywhere else in the world the whole place would be packed with visitors. This being Tasmania however, it was relatively quiet for the middle of summer.</p>\n",

In a busy 4 days, I started in Launceston before driving over to the Bay of Fires, then down to Freycinet National Park, visiting various stops on the way, and finally on to Hobart. The weather was a bit ordinary, although a nice relief from the 30+ degree temperatures in Brisbane at the moment. It was raining much of the time but I managed to get a few decent shots.</p><p>This one was taken in a small place called The Gardens in the Bay of Fires. The whole areas is extraordinarily beautiful. White beaches and turquoise waters set against orange-hued granite rocks. The orange on the rocks is produced by lichen. I've no ideas why it's particular to that area but it sure looks nice. I'll post another photo later that shows the rocks in more detail.</p><p>The water was freezing by the way, even though it is the middle of summer. It shouldn't be too surprising really given its proximity to Antarctica.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>When something tragic like what unfolded in Paris happens, we all have an opinion on what needs to be done. Well here‚Äôs mine - I‚Äôm going to play armchair general and pretend I know what I‚Äôm talking about.\nIt seems to me that the strategy for containing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh, whatever you want to call them, isn‚Äôt working. Nobody in their right minds believes that IS is going to be defeated with a bombing campaign or drone strikes. In fact, many argue, including myself, that airstrikes are counter-productive. How many innocent civilians have been killed from collateral damage in the last 12 months? How many moderate muslims have been radicalised as a result?</p>\n<p>So here‚Äôs my 5-point plan for tackling IS:</p>\n<h3>1. Send in ground troops and rebuild Syria</h3>\n<p>Nobody wants another Middle-East war. While the Afghanistan War was inevitable after 9/11, it‚Äôs pretty clear now that the Iraq War was a foreign policy disaster. You can argue about whether it was the war in general that was a mistake, or simply the post-invasion planning. Nevertheless, there is no hope of any diplomatic solution with IS. No one is going to invite IS leaders to the UN or any other forum to discuss peace terms. There is no negotiating with IS. The only option is to eliminate them, even if that means cooperating with Russia and leaving Assad in place temporarily. Dealing with Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad will have to wait.</p>\n<p>A sound military plan has to go hand in hand with a strategic recovery plan. We cannot have a repeat of the Iraq War. The US may take the lead with the military objectives but it would be wise if the US takes¬†a backseat when it comes to rebuilding Syria. The UN, supported by¬†other Middle East countries, must take the lead in bringing democracy to Syria. A new government in Syria will never be trusted if Syrians believe that it is a puppet of the US.</p>\n<h3>2. Ethical foreign policy</h3>\n<p>We need to stop supporting and selling arms to despotic regimes that support and fund terrorism - I‚Äôm looking at you Saudi Arabia. This goes to the wider policy of \"anything goes as long as it means jobs and economic growth‚Äù. It seems madness that we count on Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other countries in the region as key allies in the war on terrorism while knowing that they play both sides. You hear the argument that if we don‚Äôt sell missiles to Saudi Arabia then Russia or China will. This is what I mean by ethical foreign policy - we should do things because they are right, even if BAE loses some arms contracts and jobs are lost.</p>\n<p>A proxy war is playing out in the Middle East between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and it‚Äôs spreading. For years we thought the Shia Islamic militants backed by Iran were the biggest danger. It‚Äôs clear now that IS, backed by fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam, which has its roots in Saudi Arabia, is taking jihadism to a whole new level. With oil prices low and showing no signs of rising with the world moving to renewables, Saudi Arabia have already indicated that they need to start diversifying their economy. Therefore the Saudi royal family have a choice to make - do they risk foreign investment by failing to tackle fundamentalism, or do they bow to the clerics (who are the real power in Saudi Arabia) and continue turning a blind eye to IS.</p>\n<h3>3. Abandon the Schengen Agreement and overhaul the refugee programme.</h3>\n<p>Borderless travel around Europe is fantastic but one of the European Union‚Äôs greatest advantages is also one of its biggest vulnerabilities. The UK was right to opt-out. I have little time for the those¬†in Australia, UK and the US who say close up shop and close the borders to refugees. Surely if you support your government taking military action in Syria then your country also has a moral obligation to take in refugees as a result of the military action. That being said, when the numbers are in the hundreds of thousands it‚Äôs inevitable that some terrorists are going to slip through. As a minimum Europe needs to adopt a strictly controlled refugee programme that isolates refugees to specific countries until they can be returned to their country of origin, or until their asylum application is approved.</p>\n<p>The problem though is one of process. When you learn about the situation in the UN refugee camps and find out that it can take years for an application for asylum to be processed, you begin to understand why hundreds of thousands of refugees make the dangerous trip up through Turkey and into western Europe. Some of them are refugees who want to return to their country as soon as the war is over, and yes, others are economic migrants. We need to stop blaming the economic migrants for simply wanting to seek a better life, but at the same time accept that the levels of migration are fuelling nationalism and are having some genuine negative effects on communities. All countries need to ensure that the UNHCR is properly funded and resourced in order to cope with the refugee crisis and dramatically bring down processing times.</p>\n<h3>4. Tackle the Mosques, Islamic Community Centres, religious indoctrination of children and subjugation of Muslim women by Muslim men.</h3>\n<p>Overseas funding of mosques and Islamic community centres should be illegal. Yes, it would mean that the vast majority of legitimate non-radicalised mosques would lose funding because of the minority, but it needs to be done. This has already happened in Austria. I would also apply the same policy to all religious institutions so that the policy can‚Äôt be accused of unfairly targeting Islam. Religious indoctrination is despicable and must be stopped. At the same time moderate muslims need to do more to root out extremism. We see these Imams condemn violence and then immediately justify it by pointing to the root causes. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they have a point regarding the root causes, the message needs to be unequivocal that violence is not the answer.</p>\n<p>We also need to do more to address the endemic misogyny in many Muslim communities and families. There needs to be the right balance between religious tolerance and ensuring Muslims living in Western countries accept western values. Most of our countries now have laws against forced marriage, female genital mutilation, etc, yet these things still go on, and many Muslim men still dictate the future of the women in their lives. Within Australia, Muslim women have the lowest workplace participation, the highest rate of welfare dependency, and the lowest tertiary education participation.</p>\n<p>Finally, we should¬†do more to stop the religious indoctrination of children. Learning about religious history and customs is one thing, forcing children to read the Bible¬†or Quran¬†as revealed truth is another thing entirely. It's crazy to me that this is still happening in 2015 in supposedly secular societies. We can't begin to tackle religious extremism without tackling religion.¬†The politicians commonly trot out the same line that what we are seeing is a perversion of Islam, which is true to some extent, but we can't ignore the fact that jihad and martyrdom are concepts found in the Quran.</p>\n<h3>5. Address the root causes of muslim grievance</h3>\n<p>There is no justification for the actions of IS and Al Quaeda before them, but we can‚Äôt pretend that the rise in Islamic terrorism wasn‚Äôt borne from some genuine grievances and injustices.</p>\n<p>Until the Israel-Palestine problem is resolved we are never going to have peace in the Middle East. After all that has happened, statehood for Palestine looks further away than ever. Benjamin Netanyahu has taken a hardline stance, stoking up electoral¬†support based on fear. The only country that can do something about this is the US. The US needs to use its considerable influence to force Israel to the negotiating table. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not going to happen any time soon with a Republic majority in the US Senate.</p>\n<p>So there you have it, my 5-point plan. Of course, I‚Äôm only scratching the surface and I‚Äôm sure people wiser than I can easily point out the folly in my plan.</p>\n<h3>What not to do</h3>\n<p>Now to what should not be done.¬†We should not give in to fear and allow governments to increase blanket surveillance and undermine encryption.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôre already seeing the Paris Attacks being used as justification for increasing the powers of the intelligence agencies and passing laws that further increase blanket surveillance. France recently passed some of the toughest surveillance laws in the world. What good did it do? Blanket surveillance, as opposed to targeted surveillance, has very little impact on disrupting terrorism. Even Obama‚Äôs hand-picked advisory panel to look into the bulk metadata collection program concluded that the program ‚Äúwas not essential to preventing attacks and could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional [court] orders‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I have no problems with governments increasing the budgets of the intelligence agencies - just use the larger budgets to increase the monitoring of genuine suspects, rather than invading the privacy of the rest of us. It seems after every attack we later find out that one or more of the perpetrators were ‚Äòknown‚Äô to police or intelligence agencies.</p>\n<p>We must also never bow to the demands of David Cameron and others who want the intelligence agencies to have access to our encryption keys, or want back-doors to be placed in encryption mechanisms. This proposal is <a href=\"https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/45\">wrong, dangerous and technically infeasible</a> - encryption has long been out of the hands of any one government, industry or company.</p>\n",

It's a few degrees warmer up in Far North Queensland this time of year. No trip to Cairns is complete without at least a day out on the Great Barrier Reef.

It was a great trip but we fancied doing things a little differently this time.\nWe chose the <a href=\"http://www.oceanfree.com.au\">Ocean Free</a> tour which combines snorkelling on the Reef with a few hours on Green Island.

Mind you, it's not a place to visit on a budget - there's a reason everyone looks like they have just stepped off a yacht in Cannes.</p><p>This photo was taken from Noosa National Park looking out into the bay during sunset. It may look idyllic but shortly after that, it pissed it down!</p>\n",

However, it‚Äôs hard to review the movie without considering the source material.</p><p>I‚Äôve read other reviews that criticises the film because it shows a one-sided view of Chris Kyle and fails to tackle the politics of the Iraq War. Those reviews don‚Äôt seem to understand that the film is based on Chris Kyle‚Äôs autobiography, so of course it‚Äôs going to be one-sided. As for the politics, anyone who has read the book is in no doubt about Chris Kyle‚Äôs politics and his feelings regarding the Iraq War.</p><p>Leaving the cinema I felt a lot of sympathy for Chris Kyle and, even though I‚Äôm not an American, felt he rightly deserved his label as an American hero. These are not the feelings I had after reading the book.</p><p>It‚Äôs hard to read the book objectively and not get the opinion that a) he was a complete psychopath who loved killing, and b) he was actually a bit of an arsehole.</p><p>That person doesn‚Äôt come across in the film. Of course, in a 2 hour movie you don‚Äôt have the time to linger on the never-ending sniper kills. In the book you get the feeling that Chris is treating it like a video game - sitting on high picking off one insurgent after the other.</p><p>This is also a guy who loved nothing more than going out to bars at weekends and getting into fights with the locals.</p><p>The film also fails to adequately capture the tension and arguments between him and his wife. I heard the phrase ‚ÄúGod, Country, Family‚Äù mentioned once in the movie, whereas in the book it was a continuing focus of dispute, with Chris believing country and patriotism was more important than family, and his wife failing to understand how he can put his country before family. They both agreed that God came first, perhaps telling us a little about the role religion played in their lives.</p><p>Where I also take issue with the film is where the screenplay has taken dramatic licence with the story. The central arc of the movie revolves around the battles to capture or kill Mustafa, the deadly Syrian sniper picking off American soldiers. In truth this plays only a small role in the book and Chris Kyle has very little involvement with the missions to capture or kill Mustafa.</p><p>Bradley Copper is super as Chris Kyle and rightly deserves his oscar nomination. I was worried that the movie might give Chris more depth and complexity than what came across in the book. In this regard I believe Bradley Cooper‚Äôs portrayal was fairly accurate. My takeaway from the book was that Chris was brainwashed. The events of the Embassy bombings and 9/11, perhaps understandably, gave him a single-minded view of the Iraq war being a noble cause to protect Americans at home. There was no mention in the book or film about the dubious politics of the Iraq war. In Chris‚Äôs eyes, it was a simple tail of good against evil.</p><p>The movie is entertaining, dramatic and full of tense scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. However, if you want to understand the real Chris Kyle, read the book, and only then make up your own mind whether he really was an hero or simply a psychopath who was given an opportunity to legally kill hundreds of people.</p>\n",

If you're not familiar with Trey, he's a world-renowned landscape photographer and pioneer of High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography. He has a thriving business on the back of continually travelling the world creating stunning pictures. He has a huge social media following - over 11 million (more than Lady Gage), and has a fantastic business model - all of us can download any of his full-resolution images for free as long as it's not for commercial use - and there are no watermarks.</p>\n<p>I've been following him for a while and if my photos have started to improve lately, his tutorials are the reason.</p>\n<p>He flew into Brisbane this week for a brief visit to speak at a conference and arranged a photo walk of Brisbane through Google+. I attended along with about 150 others. It was quite a sight seeing 150 of us, all with camera gear and tripods, walk in pack around Brisbane. He was really friendly and took us through, in detail, his process for his style of photography.</p>\n<p>When you look at his portfolio you see he has some amazing skies in his photos. I asked him what he does on a photo shoot when the skies are clear blue and featureless - as is usually the case this time of year in Brisbane. I think he got what I was hinting at and he said straight off that he never does what some other photographers might do, which is mask in a sky from another photo using photoshop. I was glad to hear that because I think it's a bit disingenous if you're lucking at an amazing landscape photo which isn't the real deal.</p>\n<p>The main objective of the night was to shoot the <a href=\"http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/events/view/santos-glng-city-of-lights\">Santos City of Lights</a> from South Bank. It was quite a good show, if not a little shorter than I was expecting. I'll post some more of my pics from last night at a future data. The picture above is from the beginning of the evening, and shows the entrance to Brisbane Library. The colours and glass make the building particularly interesting, and I've tried to add to this by blending in different exposures and adding contrast and clarity to create a metallic finish. I saw Trey taking the same shot so I'll be interested to see what his version looks like. No doubt it will be amazing.</p>\n",

I'm so glad we hired a car because our little shit-mobile would never have made it!</p>\n<p>After staying in a hotel described on Tripadvisor as the Bates Motel (we actually liked it), we went to Dorrigo National Park and walked through the rainforest to the Crystal Shower Falls. </p>\n<p>There were no shortage of waterfalls to choose from but what's perhaps unique about this one is that you can actually walk behind it. If you look towards the bottom of the photo, that's a cave behind the falls that you can walk into and experience the might of that cascading water right in front of you. It was quite an experience.</p>\n",

This included using the excellent resource that is <a href=\"http://www.seat61.com\">Seat 61</a> to ensure we had good seats.</p>\n<h2>One Final Day in London</h2>\n<p>We arrived in London around lunch time and went straight to our hotel near St Pancras. We were only in London for one night this time before flying out from Heathrow the following day.</p>\n<p>We were booked into a cheap and cheerful deal at the <a href=\"http://www.premierinn.com\">Premier Inn</a>. I‚Äôm more than familar with the Premier Inn after spending many a night in them up and down the UK for work trips during my last main job in the UK.</p>\n<p>Rachelle was still coughing her guts up (bronchitis we would later learn), so after checking in, Rach confined herself to the hotel room for another day while I took Lauren to see Westminster Abbey. It was a wet, miserable grey day but that didn‚Äôt dampen my enthusiasm for getting in some more sightseeing. And after realising what she had missed out on by not joining my walk around Paris, I‚Äôm pleased to say Lauren was keen to see Westminster Abbey too.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Westminster Abbey was one of the places I never made it to when I lived in London. A big oversight on my part.</p>\n<p>The tour was fascinating, featuring a smorgasbord of Britain‚Äôs most historical figures. Westminster Abbey has been the site for coronations and royal funerals since 1066 and features literally hundreds of plaques and monuments honouring the great and good. Poet‚Äôs Corner in particular stands out as a reminder of the contribution British artists have made to English literature, honouring the masters such as Shakespeare, Dickens, Chaucer, Byron, T.S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas and many others. I hope they‚Äôre going to reserve a spot for Nick Hornby and Jeffrey Archer!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3bf5f7a813.jpg\" alt=\"Westminster Abbey\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Westminster_Abbey-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Westminster Abbey was our last sightseeing stop in London, and Europe. I returned with Lauren back to the hotel. That night we ate in the hotel‚Äôs Thyme pub restaurant. I‚Äôve always had a soft-spot for the Premier Inn‚Äôs pub restaurants and this one didn‚Äôt disappoint. A last chance for some good ol‚Äô pub grub and a ‚Äòproper‚Äô pint or two.</p>\n<p>The following day we caught the Heathrow Express and boarded a British Airways flight to Hong Kong.</p>\n<h2>Hong Kong</h2>\n<p>Hong Kong is one of those places that I‚Äôve always wanted to visit. However, in hindsight, I think I got this part of the itinerary wrong. Instead of having the relaxing stop-off on Sentosa Island on the way out, we should have done it the other way round - Hong Kong sightseeing on the way out to Europe and Sentosa Island chill-out on the way back.</p>\n<p>By the time we arrived in Hong Kong, travel weariness had well and truly set in. Rachelle had been ill for the last few days and just wanted to get home, and even I was getting to the point of indifference - ‚ÄòOh look, yet another beautiful iconic site‚Äô. I‚Äôve always regretted not doing the year-long backpack around the word thing, but perhaps I‚Äôm not cut out for it after all. Or maybe staying in comfy hotels instead of youth hostels dulls some of the travel experience.</p>\n<p>For once we didn‚Äôt really have any itinerary for Hong Kong, just a list of places we would like to visit, including Victoria Peak and the Big Buddha, neither of which we ended up visiting.</p>\n<p>For our final stop on this month-long trip I had arranged for us to stay in the <a href=\"http://www.marcopolohotels.com/hotels/hongkong/kowloon/marco_polo_hongkong/index.html\">Marco Polo Hongkong Hotel</a>, which is actually in Kowloon. I chose the hotel for its location - in the vibrant Tsim Sha Tsui district, smack bang on Victoria Harbour facing across from the spectacular Hong Kong skyline.</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt cheap but it wasn‚Äôt too expensive either given its location and facilities. It‚Äôs adjacent to the Star Ferry and adjoins the Harbour City shopping mall. We also had one of our best meals of the entire trip in the hotel‚Äôs buffet restaurant. We tend to shy away from buffet restaurants as it‚Äôs usually quantity over quality. Not so on this occasion.</p>\n<p>We arrived in Honk Kong on the Wednesday afternoon. In truth we could easily have caught the excellent public transport system to our hotel but after a 12 hour overnight flight (with no sleep), we avoided any chance of hassle and hopped in a taxi.</p>\n<p>That night and the following day was spent lazing around the hotel and wandering around Tsim Sha Tsui just taking it all in. I‚Äôd never previously visited China, or Hong Kong, so I was curious to what extent Hong Kong may have changed since Britain handed back control in 1997. From what I could tell, probably not much. Hong Kong still maintains a level of independence and autonomy under the ‚Äòone country, two systems‚Äô principle, and there is plenty of evidence of British influence from its 100-yr lease. It‚Äôs still one of the world‚Äôs leading financial centres and there‚Äôs no signs of a move away from capitalism. Everyone we spoke to spoke fluent English and all the signs were in both Chinese (don't ask me whether they were Mandarin or Cantonese) and English.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre wanting the authentic Chinese experience then Tsim Sha Tsui is probably not the place. It‚Äôs very much the Hollywood of Hong Kong, even with its very own walk of fame - the Avenue of Stars - featuring foot and hand prints of stars such as Jackie Chan, and most notably a statue of Bruce Lee.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d3d985f669.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Lee\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"bruce-lee-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>In the evening the highlight was watching the Symphony of Lights - a laser and light show set to music, beamed from the skyscrapers on the opposite side of Victoria Bay.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ad7ab842a4.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong Symphony of Lights\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Hong-Kong-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>On our final full day in Hong Kong I managed to convince Rach to join myself and Lauren for a trip across the bay on the Star Ferry. I couldn‚Äôt convince her to take the trip further up to Victoria Peak but I wasn‚Äôt too fussed. I had already settled on the fact that we were all too tired to appreciate Hong Kong and would have to wait for a return visit.</p>\n<p>While over in Hong Kong I couldn‚Äôt help myself - another Apple Store to tick off the list.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/36f7e306cb.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Store Hong Kong\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"apple-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>That evening we had another wander, taking in the sights and sounds around Victoria Harbour.</p>\n<p>On the final day we were to fly out in the evening so did a final bit of last-minute shopping in the morning. Like many other Asian cities, there's no shortage of malls. I was keen to get out of the malls though. After all, you see much more interesting things out on the streets.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/50eac95925.jpg\" alt=\"Nice hat 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"nice_hat-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:5px;\">Adapt and Survive!</div>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3d4fe6bed2.jpg\" alt=\"Wanko 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"wanko-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:5px;\">Registered Trademark - yes I am a child.</div>\n<p>I regret not buying this, whatever it is:</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/11cc47f900.jpg\" alt=\"Lamb placenta\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"lamb_placenta-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>So in summary our brief stop-off in Hong Kong was not exactly as planned but it was definitely enough of a taster to make us want to return. I'll see you next time Big Buddha!</p>\n<h2>Home Sweet Home</h2>\n<p>The Qantas flight home is a blur. I'm sure we must have resembled zombies walking through security at Brisbane Airport.</p>\n<p>This was a dream trip in every way and normally coming home from holiday is a massive deflation. Things were a little different this time though. We weren't returning to dreary old England. We live in the Sunshine State. Coming home to warm sunshine and clear-blue skies soon washed away the post-holiday blues.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if it came across in these blog posts but I absolutely loved every minute of the trip. I only wish Rach had been in better shape for the last week.</p>\n<p>The trip was the result of months of planning. It wasn't cheap either. We could have bought a new car with what we spent on this little adventure. We still drive around in our old banger. No regrets though, there's no way I would trade in the experiences for a new car. The memories of the trip will last forever. A new car depreciates as soon as you drive it off the forecourt.</p>\n",

Anyway‚Ä¶.\nThe rail journey from Grindelwald to Paris wasn‚Äôt quite as spectacular as from Venice to Grindelwald, but it was still a great way to travel. This time we caught a German Deutsche Bahn inter-city train. It ticked all the boxes - fast, on-time, clean, laptop charging points, well-stocked buffet, etc. Sometimes I sit and imagine I‚Äôm on that train now when I travel to work with Queensland Rail. Unfortunately my imagination isn‚Äôt that great. The smell of stale piss, muscle cramps from lack of room, and shivering from the air-conditioning being cranked up to ‚àí5 degrees usually snaps me out of that little daydream.</p>\n<div class=\"in-post-widget\">\n<h3>Trip Series Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/942/europe-trip-2012-part-1\">Part 1: The Planning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/970/europe-trip-2012-part-2-sentosa-island\">Part 2: Sentosa Island</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1002/europe-trip-2012-part-3-london\">Part 3: London</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1031/europe-trip-2012-part-4-family-and-friends\">Part 4: Friends and Family</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1049/europe-trip-2012-part-4-venice\">Part 5: Venice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1066/europe-trip-2012-part-6-grindelwald\">Part 6: Grindelwald</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1108/europe-trip-2012-part-7-paris\">Part 7: Paris</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2930/europe-trip-2012-part-8-london-hong-kong-home\">Part 8: London - Hong Kong - Home</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>We arrived at Paris Gare Lyon station mid-afternoon and caught a taxi to our hotel. We had booked to stay in the hotel <a href=\"http://www.adagio-city.com/gb/hotel-6790-adagio-paris-tour-eiffel/index.shtml\">Adagio Paris Tour Eiffel</a>, which was only a short distance walk from the Eiffel Tower. The hotel itself was fine, nothing special. We had a partial view of the Eiffel Tower which looks spectacular at night when lit up.</p>\n<p>I had a full itinerary planned for Paris. I had already purchased the <a href=\"http://www.conciergerie.com/paris/pass/paris-combo-pass-lite.php\">Paris Combo Pass</a> which included use of public transport and access to the Louvre Museum. As we arrived in Paris though it was looking increasingly like I‚Äôd be experiencing Paris on my own. The trip up to the freezing conditions at Jungfraujoch the day before had took its toll on Rach and she was now even worse.</p>\n<p>I had planned to start doing touristy stuff as soon as we arrived but it was clear that Rach was going nowhere. So instead we had a walk to a local supermarket, picked up some food and wine, and spent the evening in the apartment. Walking around the supermarket in Paris further re-affirmed how bad the supermarkets in Australia are. ¬¢1.99 for quite a decent bottle of Bordeaux. Paris was quickly becoming one of my favourite places!</p>\n<p>After a good night‚Äôs rest I set off early on Saturday morning to begin my sightseeing. For the first time on the trip I was on my own. Rach was confined to her death bed and Lauren decided she would rather stay in the apartment than traipse around museums with me.</p>\n<p>I hopped on a local bus and made my way over to the Louvre. I‚Äôd timed it right. If I‚Äôd have gone to the Louvre on the Sunday morning I could have got in free (the first Sunday of the month is always free entry). Whenever I see the word Free it immediately conjures up one image - Queues. This was my first time in Paris and I would happily pay to avoid standing in queues to get access to what is the most visited tourist attraction in the world. I had no desire to spend half a morning in a queue like I did with Rach when we visited the Vatican museum during our weekend away to Rome a few years ago.</p>\n<p>I arrived at the Louvre just after opening time at 9am, and was amazed to find no queues - I walked straight in. Already armed with my Rick Steves audio guide I made my way to the Denon Wing. I could have spent the entire weekend in the Louvre and not seen everything, such is the size and scope of the Louvre, so I‚Äôd already decided to limit myself to the highlights.</p>\n<p>The Louvre is the oldest and largest museum in Europe. It‚Äôs actually a 16th-Century palace arranged in a U-shape, and now adorned with a glass pyramid - a landmark for fans of The Da Vinci Code.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f65b44ddaf.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Louvre\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Louvre-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The building itself is beautiful - a fitting home for some of the world‚Äôs most celebrated and important works of art.</p>\n<p>My tour of the Denon Wing started in Ancient Greece. I was greeted by the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. I was also greeted by a hundred snap-happy Japanese tourists, all with matching baseball caps.</p>\n<p>I meandered through the Gallery of Statues (far too many statues of naked Greek people to mention) and gazed upon the Parthenon Friezes - slabs of decorated stone that once decorated the exterior of the 5th Century B.C. Parthenon. It struck me that I once visited the relics of the Parthenon in Athens while I was in the Navy and was utterly bored by the occasion, yet this time i was fascinated by a few slabs of stone from it. How times had changed. To think all the places I visited in the Navy and never really saw anything because I was young, stupid and only interested in seeing the bottom of a beer glass.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7b25636949.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Louvre\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Louvre-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>From Ancient Greece I travelled to 18th Century France in the Apollo Gallery - home to the crown jewels of Louis XV, Louis XVI and Napoleon.</p>\n<p>After a quick diversion past religious artwork from medieval Europe brought me to the Grand Gallery, home to famous pieces by Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo and of course, Leonardo Da Vinci.</p>\n<p>I doubt I‚Äôm alone in thinking that the Mona Lisa is perhaps the least spectacular piece of work in the Grand Gallery. Some of the other pieces are truly spectacular in scale and beauty, such as The Marriage at Cana by Paulo Veronese and the Winged Victory by Delacroix.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/32c2b517e5.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Louvre\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Louvre-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After seeing those it was a bit of a disappointment to finally make it to La Joconde (Mona Lisa). The painting is quite small, dark and protected behind a glass wall which is forever reflecting a hundred camera flashes, meaning that you have to get right up to the glass to view her properly, and to do that you have to battle your way past a thousand Asian tourists. It amazed me how many tourists (you know the ones I‚Äôm talking about) would finally get to the front of the queue, look at the Mona Lisa through the viewfinder of their camera, take the photo, and then walk away without actually ever viewing her with their naked retina. Unbelievable!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7c45bf8d16.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Louvre - Mona Lisa\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Louvre-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I spent perhaps another hour in the Denon Wing but it was getting far too busy for my liking so I said goodbye to the Louvre and set off on foot to the next stop on my itinerary.</p>\n<p>After a quick detour to a nearby cafe with free wi-fi, I walked down the river Seine to do the Historic Paris walking tour in the centre of Paris. Actually, the self-guided tour did in fact start at not just the centre of Paris, but the centre of France - Point Zero - this point from which all distances in France are measured.</p>\n<p>The √éle de la Cit√© is an island in the Seine River that is the original birthplace of Paris, and is home to the Notre Dame Cathedral.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2c1d48a039.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Notre Dame 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Notre-Dame-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The island was fairly busy; as well as the usual throng of tourists to see the historic sights there was some kind of Emergency Services open-day on. The police, fire service, bomb detection squad and others were all set up displaying their kit.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/df6c39d82f.jpg\" alt=\"Paris bomb disposal engineer\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-bomb-disposal-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After a wander around the exterior of the Notre Dame I considered my options. I really wanted to go in and have a look around but the queue to get in was absolutely enormous. It had started raining but that seemed to have no effect on the size of the queue.</p>\n<p>I decided to miss out this time and instead went to the side entrance to join the smaller queue to get up to the top of the bell tower.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm glad I did. Despite the awful weather I got to see some great Gargoyle-eye views of Paris.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/302876b537.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Notre Dame view\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Notre-Dame-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/633857373b.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Notre Dame view\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Notre-Dame-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a911343b4e.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Notre Dame view\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Notre-Dame-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After a further wander around √éle de la Cit√©, including a look at the bird-shit spattered statue of Charlemagne, I walked across a love-lock infested bridge to find the nearest Metro station.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7f4b04c7a5.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Charlamagne Statue\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Charlamagne-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4636ec70fe.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Bridge Love Locks\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Bridge-Love-Locks-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a586fbd48.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Bridge Love Locks 2\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Bridge-Love-Locks-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>It was now late afternoon and I was tired, wet and hungry.</p>\n<p>By the time I got back to the apartment Rach was looking a little bit better so she braved a venture out with Lauren and I for food. The original plan was for some fine French dining but Rach was in no condition for that so we walked to the nearest brasserie that would let us in without a table booking.</p>\n<p>The following day had a fully packed itinerary. This time Rach and Lauren came out with me. Rach still looked like death so I new she wouldn‚Äôt be able to last long. We walked over to the Eiffel Tower - about a 15 min walk from our hotel with the intention of going up it. One look at the queue however and that plan quickly went out the window.</p>\n<p>Instead, we walked across the river to place du Trocad√®ro, perhaps the best place in Paris to get photos of the Eiffel Tower. It‚Äôs at this point that Rach realised there was no way she was going to be able to spend the day walking around Paris so she headed back to the apartment. I asked Lauren if she wanted to stay with me but she chose to return to the apartment as well - she‚Äôs not a walker. When we talk about it now she regrets that decision - particularly when I show here photos of everything she missed.</p>\n<p>Tripod and camera in hand I set up shop to try and get some decent pics.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/513f2b16ef.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Eiffel Tower\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Eiffel-Tower-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d19113e8e8.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Eiffel Tower\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Eiffel-Tower-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After the Eiffel Tower the next step on my itinerary was the Arc de Triomphe. I took the metro directly from Place du Trocad√®ro to the Arc de Triomphe which is at the top of the Champs-Elys√©e.</p>\n<p>I joined a short queue and paid to climb the 284 steps up the spiral staircase to the top of the Arc de Triomphe. My knees were taking a pounding by this point - still aching from the climb to the top of the Notre Dame bell tower the day before.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1fc748910a.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe Stair Climb\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Before you climb out onto the roof of the Arc de Triomphe there‚Äôs the obligatory gift shop and a small mezzanine area with exhibits explaining the history of the monument, which has played a pivotal role in French history. I could picture 1940 and the Nazis goose-stepping down the Champs-Elys√©es and under the Arc du Triomphe which was blazoned with a huge swastika.</p>\n<p>The view from the top is spectacular in all directions. Apparently Paris is roughly the same size has all the parks in London combined. Fill this with 11 million people and you can see why Paris has the highest population density of any city in Europe.</p>\n<p>In every direction you can see an iconic part of Paris. Looking east you can gaze straight down the Champs-Elys√©es to the Tuileries Garden and the Louvre. Further to the left and in the distance is the white dome of Sacr√©-Coeur. To the right in the distance is the Notre-Dame.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/194d878ea4.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fe42db58d1.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 5\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-5.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eae92fb458.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 3\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Looking west you can see the huge, rectangular Grande Arche de la D√©fense amongst a few skyscrapers.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3c723d9f76.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 4\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Looking down you can see that the Arc de Triomphe sits at the intersection of 12 boulevards, a masterpiece of city planning by Baron Haussmann. At this time on a Sunday morning the roads weren‚Äôt too busy but you could image the chaos of this area on a Friday afternoon.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/74f25dbead.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 2\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The climb back down the Arc de Triomphe brought me out directly underneath to see the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/44490a6d93.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-Tomb-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/39e8dc65fb.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I took a steady walk down the Champs-Elys√©es stopping a number of times to check out some of the glitzy stores. Amongst them were flagship stores for Peugeot and Mercedez-Benz which were more like museums than car showrooms.</p>\n<p>Further down the Champs-Elys√©es brought me to the beautiful Grand and Petit Palais exhibition halls, adjacent to statues of Charles de Gaulle and Winston Churchill.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/414532165e.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Petit Palais\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Petit-Palais-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>From here it was a short walk down the tree-lined avenue to Place de la Concorde.</p>\n<p>During the French Revolution, Place de la Concorde was home to a guillotine. Now the most famous structure is the 3,300-year-old obelisk of Luxor which sits directly over the spot where Louis XVI and 2779 others were beheaded. When the monarchy was restored in the 1830s after Napoleon, Louis XVI‚Äôs brother, Charles X, had the obelisk shipped from Egypt and erected to honour those who had lost their head.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/68c1e651ee.jpg\" alt=\"Place de la Concorde\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Place-de-la-Concorde-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Today the Place de la Concorde is a major tourist trap and great for photos. Another spot popular for wedding pics.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/50493a8246.jpg\" alt=\"Place de la Concorde\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Place-de-la-Concorde-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b9ef74af18.jpg\" alt=\"Place de la Concorde 4\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Place-de-la-Concorde-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6cc855ed37.jpg\" alt=\"Place de la Concorde 3\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Place-de-la-Concorde-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>From the Place de la Concorde I walked through the Tuileries Garden. A beautiful place for a Sunday stroll. This is where the Parisians come to relax, play boules and chill out by the pond.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4760b1de49.jpg\" alt=\"Tulleries Garden\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Tulleries-Garden-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ff0b7a7819.jpg\" alt=\"Tulleries Garden 2\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Tulleries-Garden-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The walk through the Tuileries Garden brought me back to the Louvre.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/75661de3ea.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Musee de Louvre\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Musee-de-Louvre-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>From here I walked across the river to the Left Bank. By this time it was getting towards late afternoon and I was ready for a little refreshment. Like an oasis in the desert a Scottish pub appeared before me down a side street.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/05aadfd8f4.jpg\" alt=\"Paris pub\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-pub-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After a swift pint or two I left the pub to take a self-guided tour of the Left Bank area.</p>\n<p>The Left Bank is historically famous for great artists and thinkers, and with that my tour began at the statue of Voltaire, the famous writer and philosopher.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ea366e5b57.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Voltaire\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Voltaire-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>A walk past galleries and boutique stores, all closed, brought me to L‚ÄôHotel at 13 rue des Beax-Arts. It was here, on the 30th November 1900, where Oscar Wilde died of an ear-infection, alone in a shabby hotel room after released from prison and rejected by his wife.</p>\n<p>Around the corner I came across the house where the German composer Richard Wagner spent the winter of 1841‚Äì1842 writing the opera that launched his career - The Flying Dutchmen.</p>\n<p>A walk through the square where the painter Eug√®ne Delacroix lived brought me in to the heart of the Left Bank district, home to a great assortment of cafes and restaurants. By this time the evening was setting in and the area was getting busy.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/40086533e3.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Left Bank\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Left-Bank-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>My walk took me past Caf√© le Procope, one of the world‚Äôs oldest continuously operating restaurants. Le Procope was founded in 1686 and was one of the first places in Europe where you could get a coffee - recently imported form the Middle East. Apparently, Voltaire was known to drink 30 cups a day here, Benjamin Franking loved to spend hours here recounting war stories from the American Revolution, and a young lieutenant named Napoleon Bonaparte ran up a tab here that he never paid.</p>\n<p>Further into the Left Bank brought me to Les Deux Magots Caf√© and Le Caf√© de Flore, famously frequented by such luminaries as Picasso, Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Oscar Wilde and other ‚Äòfree thinkers‚Äô If you‚Äôve seen Woody Allen‚Äôs Midnight in Paris you‚Äôll get the idea.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23e48dde46.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Left Bank\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Left-Bank-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Across from Caf√© de Flore is Brasserie Lipp, the brasserie where Hemingway wrote much of A Farewell to Arms.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0b6ede37ec.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Left Bank\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Left-Bank-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I enjoyed my history tour of the Left Bank but I was getting hungry. I found a Brasserie that didn‚Äôt look too busy or too expensive and grabbed a quick bite before heading back to the apartment. Before heading back though I made sure to stop off and buy a bag of Macaroons to take back to Rach and Lauren.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23b0903438.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Macaroons\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Macaroons-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>That was the end of a great weekend (for me at least) in Paris. It was only a small taster and one day I hope to return to see more of the City of Light. I just hope next time Rachelle and Lauren will be able to share the experience with me.</p>\n<p>The next day we would be catching the Eurostar back to London for one final night in Europe.</p>\n",

Our train from Venice St. Lucia was due to leave at 07:50 but we made sure we left with plenty of time to spare. Getting to the station on the water bus wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Finding the water bus in the first place would be. In my defence, the streets were very dimly lit, there was no one around to ask directions, the map was too high level to show the water bus pickup point we needed to get, and I had no data left on my phone.</p>\n<p>To get to Grindelwald in Switzerland we had to catch four trains: Venice to Milan, Milan to Spiez, Spiez to Interlaken, and finally Interlaken to Grindelwald. This was one of the main reasons I wanted to travel light. Unfortunately, I was travelling with two females so my request fell on deaf ears.</p>\n<p>Luckily we had no problems. In fact, travelling by rail in Europe is an absolute joy, we loved every minute of it. Travelling through Northern Italy past the Italian Lakes and up into the Swiss Alps must surely be one of the best rail journeys in the world.</p>\n<p>I was all set up with a beer and some movies on my iPad but who needs an iPad when you have those views.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6d9e6da05d.jpg\" alt=\"View of Northern Italy from the train\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"IMG_2168.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>We eventually arrived in Grindelwald mid-afternoon. Grindelwald was everything we had hoped for and more. We stepped off the train into cool, fresh mountain air and, just like Venice, it felt like we were stepping into a painting.</p>\n<p>Grindelwald sits 1,034m above sea level in the Bernese Alps, nestled between the imposing Eiger, M√∂nch and Jungfrau mountains. Officially it was still the summer season so there was no snow on the ground - we would have to climb much higher for that.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fc6a55ddd0.jpg\" alt=\"Grindelwald\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-19.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I couldn‚Äôt wait to get amongst it and breathe the fresh alpine air. Looking at Rachelle however, I feared she wasn‚Äôt in a fit state to join me yodelling amongst the mountains. She had started to feel like she was coming down with something while we were in Venice, and by the time we reached Grindelwald she was in full blown cough-her-guts-up mode. She toughed it out while we were in Grindelwald but that would effectively be the end of her holiday.</p>\n<p>We stayed at the <a href=\"http://www.hotel-gletschergarten.ch/\">Hotel Gletscergarten</a>, a charming family run chalet-hotel that has been around for 113 years. Our room had a skylight so when you laid on the bed you could look straight up at the Eiger mountain. It was very quiet when we visited in October. I think I only saw one other guest the whole time we were there.</p>\n<p>The whole village was quiet. That evening after arriving we tried out one of the restaurants and we were the only ones in there. After the meal we went back to the hotel and Lauren dragged us down to the games room. She was in her element - the whole games room to herself. We played table tennis for the first time in a very long time.</p>\n<p>We only had one full day in Grindelwald and there were a number of options for things to do that Thursday. One of them was a trip up to <a href=\"http://www.schilthorn.ch/en/schilthorn/\">Schilthorn</a> - a 32 min cable car ride up to the summit where a significant amount of On Her Majesty‚Äôs Secret Service was filmed. For a Bond fan like me, that was very tempting.</p>\n<p>As great as this sounded, all the guide books and travel sites told me that if you only have one day in Grindelwald a trip to Jungfraujoch should be top of the must-do list.</p>\n<h2>Jungfraujoch</h2>\n<p>Jungraujoch is called the ‚ÄòTop of Europe‚Äô because at 3454 metres, it is Europe‚Äôs highest railway station, and the train journey to get there is described as one of the great train journeys of the world.</p>\n<p>We were warned to check the weather forecast early morning before we set off. If it was forecast bad weather over Jungfrau there would be no point going up as visibility would be zero. Thankfully, the forecast was good.</p>\n<p>We left early to beat the crowds to the top. At the station I handed over my life savings for 3 tickets. This must surely be the most expensive per-km railway journey anywhere in the world?</p>\n<p>We got on the train and was joined by two thousand Japanese tourists. Great. All trip it seemed like we were surrounded by snap-happy Japanese tourists. I hate to stereotype any nationality but Jesus they really need to have a word with themselves about camera etiquette. All trip we had been surrounded by them taking photographs of absolutely everything, and I mean absolutely everything. It never ceased to amaze me when I saw them go over to look at an amazing view or take a picture of a famous landmark, snap the picture and immediately walk away without actually looking at it without a lens. What‚Äôs the point in that? They might as well have stayed at home and looked at photo‚Äôs on the Internet. A lot of them were also using their iPad to take pictures. Apart from the fact that they look stupid holding an iPad up to their face to take photo‚Äôs, the iPad is a crap camera. The iPhone on the other hand is an excellent camera. We even saw one Japanese woman on her own on a kids ride in Singapore filming herself for the full duration of the ride. Bizarre.</p>\n<p>Half of them don‚Äôt even know how to use a camera, like leaving their flash on for every night shot even if they‚Äôre taking a photo of a building 300 feet away - as if their tiny little flash is going to light up the entire city skyline. Rant over.</p>\n<p>The journey to the top took approx 50 minutes with two short stops on the way. The first stop was at Eigerwand (Eiger Wall). We stepped out onto the viewing platform and was greeted with spectacular views down into the valleys.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f1e526387a.jpg\" alt=\"Jungfrau valleys\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-22.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>At this point though we were still among the green mountains. It was the second stop at Eismeer (Sea of Ice) that blew me away. I stepped on to the viewing platform and it was as if we had stepped into another world. Gone was the greenery - replaced with snow and ice as far as the eye can see. It was truly breathtaking.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d7018cbe79.jpg\" alt=\"Sea of Ice\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-27.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The cogwheel rail carriage slowly took us up the tunnel that burrows through the Eiger and Monch mountains and into Jungfrau. The tunnel and railway station was completed in 1912. Within the complex there is a memorial to the many engineers that died during construction.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e29ff14039.jpg\" alt=\"Jungfraujoch memorial\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-36.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The highest railway station in Europe is unlike any I‚Äôd ever been to. On exiting the train you enter a series of tunnels that connect different features of the vast complex. After walking through the Ice Palace we went outside on to one of the peaks. There is an area that is cordoned off with ropes to stop you literally sliding off the mountain. Thank god for those ropes. Rach and Lauren took a few steps out before turning around and going back in. All around us tourists were falling on their backside - slipping on the ice. It would have been funny if I wasn‚Äôt concentrating so hard on keeping upright myself!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/00803cb4d7.jpg\" alt=\"Jungfraujoch peak\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-42.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>At that point the weather and visibility was good. I went to the edge of the peak gazed out at the Alps before me. It really was worth every one of the many Swiss Francs we paid to get to the top.</p>\n<p>After lunch we went to the Sphinx Observatory Tower which is at the summit of the Sphinx - a peak that lies just to the east of the col. By that point it had started snowing and Rach was in no state to go outside, so I went outside with Lauren. The Sphinx Observatory Tower offers 365 degree views but bad weather had suddenly descended on us and visibility was really poor. We couldn‚Äôt see a thing but Lauren loved it nonetheless. The last time she had experienced she was about 4 so really can‚Äôt remember it.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0ed029d8c7.jpg\" alt=\"Sphinx Observatory\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-55.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs a video I found on YouTube that provides an overview of Jungfraujoch:</p>\n<p>[youtube [www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkjV1mwQx6k])</p>\n<p>We returned to Grindelwald mid-afternoon. Rach went straight back to the hotel as by that time she really was coughing her guts up. I took Lauren for a game of crazy golf.</p>\n<p>That evening we had a quiet night relaxing in the hotel. We would be catching a train to Paris the next day so a little bit of relaxation was called for before another cram-it-in city visit.</p>\n<p>I loved our short time in Grindelwald and we were gutted to leave. We could have easily spent a week there.</p>\n",

The water bus would have been cheaper but at that time of night it was too late to mess about. I wasn‚Äôt even sure they still ran past midnight. Luckily we managed to share a water taxi with a Scottish couple. On our own it would have been over ¬¢100.</p>\n<p>We cruised down the Grand Canal towards our hotel. This is the way to arrive! It reminded me of that scene in Casino Royale towards the end when James Bond cruises down the Grand Canal in a luxury yacht, before (spoiler alert) Eva Green goes on to betray him. Well this wasn‚Äôt quite a luxury yacht and I hadn‚Äôt just finished convalescing at a luxury retreat after being tortured for my poker winnings, but that didn‚Äôt stop me considering the similarities.</p>\n<p>We got lost for the first of many times to come trying to find our hotel. In fact, we had walked past it and completely missed the sign. Luckily Rach was on the ball when we doubled back to look again. We were only there for two nights so had booked in to a cheap Guest house - the <a href=\"http://www.palazzorosa.com/en/\">Palazzo Rosa</a>.</p>\n<p>After far too little sleep we were up early that Tuesday morning to make the most of the day. We only had one full day in Venice so we were determined to make the most of it. Unlike other places on our trip I hadn‚Äôt booked tickets for any of the sights in Venice. I had already determined from the guide books that there was enough to see just walking around Venice in a day, without trying to fit in tours of St Mark‚Äôs Basilica, Doge‚Äôs Palace or the other major sites that would undoubtedly require spending a good amount of time waiting in queues. We would have to save them for a future trip.</p>\n<p>Venice is a magnificent walking city. We walked and walked and walked that day and loved every minute of it. Even Lauren enjoyed it. Well, she didn‚Äôt complain about the walking which was a rare treat. Walking the streets of Venice is like stepping into a renaissance-era painting.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1557972623.jpg\" alt=\"Venice grand canal 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Everywhere you look there‚Äôs a feast for the eyes; the pastel colours of the buildings, the ornate f√≥rcolas on the gondolas, the hidden gardens, the carnival masks and Morano glass displayed in the boutique shop windows.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8be0abfb8a.jpg\" alt=\"Venetian Masks\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/209b013050.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Gondola\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a magical city and in my opinion we chose the perfect time to visit. It was busy but not over-crowded as I‚Äôm told it is in the heights of summer. The sun was out and it was warm - not too warm or too cold, the perfect temperature for walking. There were a few puddles about hinting at earlier rain but there wasn‚Äôt a drop of rain while we were there. It was bliss.</p>\n<p>Some people had described Venice to me as dirty and smelly. I didn‚Äôt find that at all. All I could smell was the fresh salty sea air.</p>\n<p>We walked from our hotel towards St Mark‚Äôs Square (Piazza San Marco), passing over the Rialto Bridge. The narrow streets and small squares were bustling with tourists but, again, it wasn‚Äôt over-crowded.</p>\n<p>Italy is renowned for its Piazzas and surely San Marco must be its finest. Dominated at one end by the byzantine-style domes of St Mark‚Äôs Basilica and the towering Campanile, and surrounded by a mixture of renaissance, baroque, and neo-classical buildings on each side that once held the offices that governed the vast Venetian empire that stretched all the way to Turkey.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a9ae4ab716.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Campanile\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We took a seat at one of the pavement cafe‚Äôs with a live orchestra, knowing that I was probably about to drink the most expensive coffee I‚Äôd ever purchased. I didn‚Äôt mind. If you‚Äôre going to over-pay for a coffee where better than a beautiful morning in St Mark‚Äôs while being serenaded by a live classical orchestra. Only after sitting down did I realise that we were sat at Caff√® Florian - one of the first places in Europe to serve coffee (Circa 1720).</p>\n<p>That morning San Marco was alive with tourists marvelling at their surroundings, and parents watching their kids chase the pigeons, as I‚Äôm sure it is every morning.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f588e0e906.jpg\" alt=\"Venice St Mark's Square\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On leaving St Mark‚Äôs we briefly considered getting tickets for a tour of either St Mark‚Äôs Basilica, Doge‚Äôs Palace, or the Campanile, but that quickly left our heads after we saw the queues. If we had been in Venice for longer I would have bought tickets in advance.</p>\n<p>The rest of the morning and afternoon was spent wandering the city, getting lost and loving it. Every now and again we would spot a sign-post pointing to San Marco or Rialto, which would help us re-gain our bearings. If all else failed we could always refer to the life-saver which is Google Maps on my iPhone.</p>\n<p>We briefly joined the tourists jostling for a spot to take a photo of the Bridge of Sighs, so called, according to legend, because when the prisoners passed through the bridge from Doge's Palace on the left to the prison the right, they took one final look at glorious Venice and sighed, before entering the dark, dank prison. It was called the Prisons' Bridge before Lord Byron renamed it in the 19th Century.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2916505e39.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Bridge of Sighs\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>For lunch we found a small Trattoria and went for some traditional Italian pizza. Sat outside eating our lunch we had to laugh when a group of Japanese tourists came up and asked the waiter if they could get their photo taken in front of the restaurant holding one of the pizza boxes.</p>\n<p>We returned to our hotel mid-afternoon to get changed for the evening. We wanted to head out for the evening while it was still light so that we could take a sunset ride on a gondola.</p>\n<p>If Venice looks great mid-day, it looks absolutely stunning during the soft light of sunset - a great time to take a Gondola ride. It‚Äôs expensive but you can‚Äôt go to Venice and not take a Gondola ride. Rach and I sat in the customary couples position while Lauren had her own special chair back towards the gondolier. Most of the other gondolas had honeymooners so it may have looked a little odd with the three passengers but we weren‚Äôt bothered, if anything it was even more special having Lauren with us.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/047f0cb435.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Sunset\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/07d2c1d671.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Rialto Bridge\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Some of the Gondoliers serenade their customers singing songs from the opera through the canals of Venice. I‚Äôm glad to say ours limited it to the occasional history lesson of the buildings we were passing. Once we were out of the Grand Canal it was wonderfully relaxing drifting through the small canals with only the sound of the water lapping the sides.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/35a2e14fc7.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Canal\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>That evening we went for Dinner at a restaurant next to the Grand Canal near the Rialto bridge. For once I hadn‚Äôt done any research on restaurants or booked ahead so it was chosen purely at random. Once seated I did as the Venetians do and ordered a pre-dinner Spritz. Rach had a Bellini. The meal was pretty average but we had no complaints about the location.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b5c0c3f305.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Gondolas\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Later, we wandered back to the hotel passing some mouth-watering Gelato, wishing that we had skipped dessert.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/232f564ef6.jpg\" alt=\"Venice gelato\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The next morning we had to be up bright and early to get to the train station for our 07:50 train onwards to our next destination.</p>\n<p>Venice is one of the most beautiful and unique places I‚Äôve ever visited. One day wasn‚Äôt nearly enough. We will return!</p>\n",

The full clan was there to greet us and it was lovely to see them all again and meet the new arrivals. Rach was in her element finally getting to cuddle her new nephew and niece. The beers were cracked open and we stayed up gabbing long past midnight.</p>\n<h2>Doncaster</h2>\n<p>On Saturday morning we went to <a href=\"http://www.robinhoodairport.com/\">Robin Hood airport</a> to pick up an hire car we had booked. I still find it a bit weird calling it Robin Hood airport. It‚Äôs not even in Nottinghamshire. Maybe the very end of the runway just goes over the border into Nottinghamshire but that‚Äôs a pretty tenuous connection. It was formerly RAF Finningley and with one of the longest runways in the UK it was used during the Cold War to launch nuclear-armed Vulcan bombers. That runway doesn‚Äôt look to be getting much action these days.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm sure when they turned Finningley into a commercial airport in 2005 they had thoughts of it becoming a major international hub. After all, the runway is long enough to land an A380. When we arrived that Saturday morning it was like a ghost town.</p>\n<p>We walked into the terminal to the hire-car desk and we must have been the only people in there that weren‚Äôt staff. The woman on the Hertz desk looked pleased to see us, I think we were the only reservation she had that day! She told us that the barman at the airport bar across from the rental desks is usually falling asleep in the afternoon. They were only doing two passenger flights a day.</p>\n<p>I had booked a Honda Accord or similar, however, the car we had reserved had developed an engine fault so they offered us a Nissan Qashqai instead. A Nissan what? I‚Äôd never heard of it. I don‚Äôt think they sell them in Australia. We had to pay a bit extra as it was an upgrade but I had no complaints when I got in it - a lovely ride with all the gadgets. It came as a bit of a surprise the following day when I had to put it into reverse for the first time and a reversing camera appeared where the large built-in SatNav display is. It made a bit of a difference to my usual ride - our shitty old Toyota Corolla. Our shit-heap was only supposed to be a temporary run-around when we arrived in Australia before we invested in a better one. 5 years later and we‚Äôve still got the shit-heap after realising that a car isn‚Äôt an investment. You invest in assets. Assets aren‚Äôt supposed to lose value from the day you buy them. Anyone who lists their car as an asset and not a liability is kidding themselves.</p>\n<p>As lovely as the Nissan Qashqai was to drive, it did share one thing in common with our Toyota Corolla - a lack of power. It really struggled up hills. Only a pretend 4x4 then.</p>\n<p>After picking up the hire-car we went for a drive around Doncaster to check out some of our old haunts. We drove past our old house in Cantley, disgusted by what the new residents had done with the place - building a fake, plastic porch on the front that looked completely out of place with the style of the house.</p>\n<p>We also went to Asda to pick up a few bits. Oh how we miss Asda. Australia is dominated by the supermarket duopoly of Coles and Woolworths and this lack of competition means supermarkets in Australia have no where near the range or quality of goods that you get in UK supermarkets.</p>\n<p>We quickly made our way to the booze aisles and were gobsmacked to find our favourite Australian wines cheaper in Asda (1600km away) than back home. Ludicrous!</p>\n<p>The rest of the weekend was spent visiting family and friends in what was one very busy, non-stop weekend.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs surprising how much you forget in 5 years. The first time I drove to Worksop from Doncaster that weekend I had to put the Satnav on. It was ridiculous. I used to drive that route every weekend but now I was completely confused. It wasn‚Äôt as if the roads had changed. I just couldn‚Äôt remember the route. Luckily, after driving it once it all came flooding back and I was driving around Doncaster and Worksop like I‚Äôd never left. For a while though it felt like I was on Mars.</p>\n<p>Monday morning came and we packed our bags once more to head down south for three days of more sight-seeing. This time though we were travelling in force - both sets of parents were joining us for the trip.</p>\n<h2>The Cotswolds</h2>\n<p>It‚Äôs amazing how many places in the UK we had never visited. Places which we would have considered at the time to be too far away for a day-trip. Living in Australia has changed our perspective on distance. You can fit the size of the UK into just Queensland 7 times, and crossing the country from Brisbane to Perth is like flying from London to Baghdad (in distance that is, I‚Äôm not comparing Perth to Baghdad!).</p>\n<p>One of these places that I‚Äôd never visited before was the Cotswolds. Or maybe I had. I‚Äôm pretty sure that when I was young the Cotswolds were not a well known tourist attraction as they are today; more some pretty villages that you could stop off at on the way down to Devon or Cornwall.</p>\n<p>The Cotswolds covers a 25 by 90 mile chunk of Gloucestershire and is famous for its historic town and villages which, in medieval Britain, kick-started the wool trade.</p>\n<p>Our first stop would be <a href=\"http://www.chippingcampden.co.uk/\">Chipping Campden</a>. This market town was once the home to the richest wool merchants and is known for its beautiful thatched cottages and high street. Typically, as we made our way south that morning the heavens opened up and it started chucking it down. Really chucking it down. As we entered rural Gloucestershire there were signs that the roads were starting to flood and it wasn‚Äôt long before we were having to ease the car through huge puddles that had formed where the roads cut through the valleys. We had come prepared so out came the waterproof jackets as soon as we got to Chipping Campden.</p>\n<p>We arrived close to lunch time so we headed for the nearby <a href=\"http://www.eightbellsinn.co.uk/\">Eight Bells pub</a>, a charming 14th Century inn. Was it too early to have a pint? No I don‚Äôt think so, I was on holiday!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f6e9b389cf.jpg\" alt=\"Eight Bells Pub\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>After lunch the rain had eased off slightly so we went for a walk through this pretty little town. In the centre of the High St stands Chipping Campden‚Äôs most famous monument - the Market Hall. Built in 1627 by Sir Baptist Hicks, it may now be an empty shell but in its day it was a thriving centre of trade for the region. Merchants from as far away as Venice would travel here to barter for the finest wool in Europe, the guide books tell us. Looking up at the roof of the Market Hall from beneath you can see that the Cotswold stone roof is still held to together by wooden pegs, and the timber roof supports are true to the original.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/857d4f77b0.jpg\" alt=\"Chipping Campden Market Hall\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Adjacent to the market hall is a World War 1 monument, reminding us of the high price Chipping Campden and other small towns such as this paid during the Great War.</p>\n<p>I could see why tourist flock to this area. This and the other towns and villages that constitute the Cotswolds retain an idealistic view of old England. The town‚Äôs street plan and property lines remain as they were in the 12th century and the High St remains, architecturally, as it was in the 1840‚Äôs - all the houses made of the same Cotswolds stone. Thankfully for us visitors, planning law ensure it stays that way.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/198e934531.jpg\" alt=\"Chipping Campden Church\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We left Chipping Campden and took a short drive through picturesque countryside to <a href=\"http://www.bourtoninfo.com/\">Bourton-on-the-Water</a>, known as the ‚ÄòVenice of the Cotswolds‚Äô. I‚Äôm not sure the likeness is entirely deserved after visiting Venice later in our trip. Nevertheless, I could see why hordes of tourists flock there in the summer. Even on this damp, miserable day, you could still appreciate the quaintness. The weather meant that this small town was relatively quiet for our visit. I enjoyed the tranquility as we walked along the canal - I‚Äôm sure it would be anything but tranquil in the heights of summer.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/849eaf1466.jpg\" alt=\"Bourton-on-the-Water\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2a3f2c0509.jpg\" alt=\"Bourton-on-the-Water High St\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>After the obligatory traditional Afternoon Tea we left Bourton-on-the-Water and headed south-west to the B&B I had booked us for the night on the way to Bath - the <a href=\"http://www.barbersbridge.co.uk/\">Dark Barn Lodge</a> near Gloucester. A good evening meal, drinks and a comfortable bed helped us refresh for the following day.</p>\n<h2>Bath</h2>\n<p>We were up bright and early the Tuesday morning for a full English breakfast before driving to Bath, another major tourist destination in the UK that I had somehow never made it to in the 32 years that I lived in the UK.</p>\n<p>I had hopes that Bath would be like York, one of our favourite cities in England, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Much like York - Bath has some of the most well-preserved roman remains in the UK. It also has some of the finest Georgian architecture.</p>\n<p>We arrived in Bath and headed straight for the <a href=\"http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/default.aspx\">Roman Baths</a>. We took a self-guided tour using the audio guides provided. One of the things I liked about the tour was that, as well as having the usual historian narrating the guide, there‚Äôs also a choice to listen to Bill Bryson give his own take on the exhibits and artefacts on the tour. If you‚Äôre a fan of Bill Bryson like I am you‚Äôll enjoy his alternative commentary which is a little less dry than the standard audio guides.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/11318b96ed.jpg\" alt=\"Bath\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>When I was a kid the Romans were covered extensively in the school curriculum. It‚Äôs amazing how much came back to me as I viewed the excavated baths and exhibits explaining how the Romans changed and civilised Britain.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/120c36956c.jpg\" alt=\"Roman\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>After the tour we thought about having lunch at the adjacent <a href=\"http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/food_and_drink/pump_room_restaurant.aspx\">Pump Room restaurant</a>, but as soon as we walked in and saw the queue we thought again. Reservations are recommended! Instead, we went to a local pub for lunch.</p>\n<p>After lunch, we made the short walk to the Circus and the Royal Crescent - both magnificent examples of Georgian architecture. The Circus, true to its name, is a circular arrangement of houses, all pretty much identical from the front - like the Rome Coliseum turned inside out. Quite fitting when you remember that Bath, with its seven hills, aspired to be the ‚ÄòRome of England‚Äô.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3cb055135a.jpg\" alt=\"The Circus\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The ground-floor entrances were made wide enough for the aristocrats to be carried straight through in their sedan chairs, and tall enough so that the ladies could enter without disturbing their towering hairdos. On the top-floor you can see the tiny round windows which would have been the servant's quarters.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/19b1fc9d56.jpg\" alt=\"The Circus Top Floor\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>I stood in the centre of the Circus, amongst the grand plane trees, and admired the 360 degree panorama around me. I‚Äôd read that if you clap, it echoes three times around the Circus. I tried it, and it did, kind of. I must have started a trend because all of a sudden groups of tourists around me tried the same.</p>\n<p>The Royal Crescent is only a block away from the Circus. As we arrived, however, the heavens opened, so we quickly retreated to a nearby cafe.</p>\n<p>Mid-afternoon we checked in to our hotel. I had booked us all into the Hilton, making use of some of my air-miles. Rach did her lady of leisure thing and soaked in the bath with a glass of wine. A spur of the moment decision earlier that day had led me to book a table at Jamie Oliver‚Äôs Italian for us all that evening. It was a good decision. That evening we convened at the Hilton bar for a few cocktails before crossing over the road to Jamie‚Äôs Italian for another fantastic meal. Food, service, all impeccable, and it wasn‚Äôt that expensive. I believe there‚Äôs a few Jamie‚Äôs Italians around the UK and they‚Äôre priced below what you‚Äôd expect for a celebrity Chef restaurant. Rach was happy as the staff let her take home a few Jamie‚Äôs Italian hand towels.</p>\n<h2>Longleat House and Safari Park</h2>\n<p>Wednesday morning we were up bright and early to check out of the hotel and make the short journey to <a href=\"http://www.longleat.co.uk/\">Longleat House and Safari Park</a>. This had been on Rachelle‚Äôs to-do list for a long time and was one of the first visits she requested when we booked the holiday.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/42026fbb45.jpg\" alt=\"Longleat House\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We started with a guided tour of the house. Wherever you are in the UK you‚Äôre never far from a historic house that has been turned into a museum. Longleat House is probably one of the better one, and while it is open to the public for much of the year, it‚Äôs still a living, breathing home to Lord Bath and his family.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/70fa9cc841.jpg\" alt=\"Longleat House Dining\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The ground floor to the house is much like any other mansion of the period. Think Downton Abbey. It‚Äôs the upstairs apartments that remind you that house isn‚Äôt owned by any old Lord of the Manor. If you look up the word ‚Äòquirky‚Äô in the dictionary you may see a picture of Lord Bath next to it. We could only get a small glimpse of his private apartments but from what we saw they could be described as quirky - on steroids!</p>\n<p>After the tour we hopped back in the car for the drive around the Safari Park. Lauren got in my Mum and Dad‚Äôs car as we thought it wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea to take the hire car through the monkey enclosure.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b543a83e8c.jpg\" alt=\"Safari Park Monkey Enclosure\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The Safari Park is a fair size, as it should be, and most of the animals come right up to the car. Whilst I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the same as an adventure through the Masai Mara, for a fraction of the price of an African safari Longleat in Wiltshire aint that bad.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8e3f8a24b3.jpg\" alt=\"Safari Park 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>After the ride through the park we went for another self-guided walk through the house before hopping on a the ‚ÄòJungle Cruise‚Äô, which sails past some Gorillas, and a shy Hippo (which I couldn‚Äôt spot). The cruise gave Lauren a chance to feed the seals.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c41ce18831.jpg\" alt=\"Safari Park 3\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0040ea11d7.jpg\" alt=\"Safari Park 4\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Besides the House and Safari Park there‚Äôs a fair few attractions at Longleat that we would have made the most of, if only the weather was a little better. But that‚Äôs Britain for you. Nonetheless, you could easily enjoy 2 days at Longleat.</p>\n<p>That was the end of our mini-break and we headed back up north, with a quick detour past Stonehenge.</p>\n<p>Thursday through to Friday is a long blur of more family and friend visits in Worksop and Doncaster, and far too much alcohol.</p>\n<h2>Worksop</h2>\n<p>On the Friday night, I had made plans to go out on the town with my life-long friend Mark to celebrate his birthday. Unfortunately, that town was Worksop. I can‚Äôt blame him, it was my idea. For some reason after a long time away I had some crazy sentimental yearning to re-visit the nightlife of my youth. As it turned out, the nightlife of my youth had long since retired to a rehab clinic.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd been warned that the nightlife had changed since the introduction of 24-hr pub licences, and particularly with the effects of the recession, but this was ridiculous. The pubs were empty, even after midnight. Midnight, I was told, was the new 8pm. It was more like 11am on a Monday morning.</p>\n<p>It was pretty sad really. Each pub was the same - perhaps twenty customers at the most. The dance floors empty with the exception of a couple of The Only Way is Essex wannabes dancing around their handbags. What has happened to English women in the last 5 years? Fake tans, fake nails, hair extensions, dresses too small for their kebab-infested bodies. It was like a Victorian freak show.</p>\n<p>I swapped horror stories by text with Rach who had the wiser decision to go out in Doncaster with her friend Paula. Mind you, by the sound of it Doncaster wasn‚Äôt that much better.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve now been told that nobody goes out any more on a Friday night. Saturday night is much busier. Lightweights! When I was a lad Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights were all heaving.</p>\n<p>The experience did remind me why I stopped going out in Worksop a long time before we emigrated. When I did go out it would more likely be to the big smoke - Sheffield. I was so adventurous!</p>\n<p>On the Saturday morning I woke up on the sofa at my parent‚Äôs house by Mum with a cup of tea and some breakfast. How comes wives never have as much sympathy for a hangover as Mums? After briefly contemplating ditching the wife, child and life in Australia, and moving back in with my Mum and Dad, I remembered I had a wedding to attend.</p>\n<p>I drove back over to Doncaster to rejoin Rach and Lauren for the wedding of her 2nd cousin, John. It was a great day. The service took place in a beautiful little church in Armthorpe, followed by a reception lunch and evening party at the <a href=\"http://www.theearl.co.uk/\">Earl of Doncaster Hotel</a>, known for its exquisite art-deco interior design.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4c0f1631b9.jpg\" alt=\"Earl of Doncaster Hotel\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The Sunday was our final day with family. It culminated with a farewell dinner at the <a href=\"http://www.vintageinn.co.uk/thehareandtortoisedoncaster/\">Hare and Tortoise pub</a> - a favourite of ours when we lived in Doncaster. Both sets of parents, brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces were there to say goodbye, with plenty a tear shed.</p>\n<h2>Harry Potter</h2>\n<p>We left Doncaster early Monday morning for our final UK visit before catching a flight from Gatwick Airport to our next destination.</p>\n<p>We had tickets for the new <a href=\"http://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/\">Harry Potter Movie Studios Tour</a> at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesdon.</p>\n<p>Lauren is a Harry Potter nut, being at that age where she has grown up with the franchise. It‚Äôs fair to say she was a little excited about this little stop-off!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3b168e5437.jpg\" alt=\"Weasley House\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The tour was pretty impressive, but not yet great. I‚Äôm sure over time it will grow into a wonderful experience but for me it seemed to be missing something. Die hard fans will love it, I‚Äôm sure. Perhaps I was too annoyed by the snap-happy camera-wielding idiots who kept getting in my way every time I tried to read something. That‚Äôs the problem with everyone having a camera-phone in their pockets these days - they feel the need to take a photo of every single inanimate object. I might be being a bit hypocritical but at least I try and limit my photo taking to pics that tell the story of my trip. Not just any old shite.</p>\n<p>There were some impressive features along the tour, including the Great Hall, Diagon Alley, and a huge replica model of Hogwarts castle that is quite breathtaking, both in its size and detail.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2747d72900.jpg\" alt=\"Hogwarts\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Lauren loved it, that‚Äôs the most important thing. The tour had the obligatory exit through the gift shop, where Lauren could have spent all day, I‚Äôm sure.</p>\n<p>So that was it. The UK portion of our trip was over and we were just over halfway through our trip in total. The days were passing by far too quickly.</p>\n",

We arrived at Heathrow just after 5am on the Tuesday morning and was met by my parents at Arrivals. It was great to see them again. It had been 2 years since we last saw them - when they came over for our wedding.</p>\n<p>On our way out of Arrivals I spotted some vending machines selling PAYG SIM cards so I picked up a couple up for Rach and I. We had both made sure our phones were unlocked before travelling. Having Internet access would be very handy in London. I‚Äôd already loaded up my iPhone with London-specific apps. The only problem is, as we discovered, it‚Äôs a bit of a pain for visitors to top-up the phones. We had o2 accounts and when we tried to top-up online it wouldn‚Äôt let us because they don‚Äôt accept credit cards registered to an overseas address. How stupid is that? I rang them and they confirmed that our only option would be to top-up at one of the shops. This was ok in London but it meant we couldn‚Äôt use the same SIM when travelling around the rest of Europe, or at least we could only use it until our credit ran out. It was handy having the SIM in London but even if you don‚Äôt buy a SIM you could probably get away with wifi. The city seems to be blanketed with free wifi hotspots.</p>\n<p>I was surprised to find when we got to Venice that the overseas data charges for the 02 SIM was only ¬£1.99 per day. That‚Äôs in stark contrast to the Australian telcos who charge a fortune for overseas roaming. Incidentally, we had also purchased TravelSIMs from Australia Post before we left, which work in any country. My advice is if you want the SIM primarily for data, forget it. The TravelSIM is fairly reasonable for phone calls but for data it‚Äôs a rip-off, if you even manage to get it to work that is.</p>\n<p>I digress. We had booked into the <a href=\"http://www.princessquarehotel.co.uk/\">Princess Square Hotel </a>near Bayswater - a cheap B&B. It‚Äôs in a great area, a couple of blocks away from Hyde Park and close to both the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations. It‚Äôs cheap but you get what you pay for. There wasn‚Äôt enough room to swing a cat in our room. It‚Äôs pretty standard in London for the rooms to be small but that one took the biscuit. Oh well, we had no intention of spending much time in the hotel. At least the beds were comfortable.</p>\n<p>Accepting that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep on the flight I had paid for the night before so that we could get our heads down for a few hours as soon as we arrived. That was the plan. As it happened we were wide awake, eager to get amongst it. I say ‚Äòwe‚Äô, Lauren was straight off - snoring her head off. We let her have a couple of hours and then headed out.</p>\n<h2>London Day 1</h2>\n<p>We didn‚Äôt have much of an itinerary for the first day. We figured we‚Äôd pick up tickets for the <a href=\"http://www.bigbustours.com/eng/london/custompage.aspx?id=london_sightseeing_tour&gclid=\">Big Bus</a> open-deck bus tour and start the circuit. This was Lauren‚Äôs first trip to London (that she could remember) so the hop-on hop-off bus tour is a good way to get an orientation of the city. With the Big Bus ticket you also get a river cruise on the Thames included.</p>\n<p>That would be later. First we caught the tube to Oxford St, had a walk down Oxford St towards Piccadilly Circus, stopping for lunch on the way.</p>\n<p>There were a number of things that we were looking forward to with this being our first trip back to the UK in 5 years, and one of those was to have a proper pub-lunch. This may seem insignificant but it‚Äôs surprising how much you miss the little things. The pubs in Australia are very different. They‚Äôre good too in their own way but there‚Äôs something very cozy and quaint about a traditional English pub serving proper Ale and pub-grub. Bliss!</p>\n<p>After lunch we continued our walk and came across one of the Big Bus tour outlets so picked up our tickets. The tickets last for 24 hours so if you purchase them in the afternoon you can use them until the same time the following day, which is what we did.</p>\n<p>We had planned to meet my parents at some point in the afternoon, we were just waiting for them to ring. We hopped on the bus and made it as far as Trafalgar Square when they rang us to say they were on their way. We told them we‚Äôd hop-off and meet them in Covent Garden.</p>\n<p>Covent Garden holds fond memories for me from my time in the Navy. I was stationed at what was then the St Vincent Maritime Communication Centre (ComCen) for a brief 6-months - underneath the old Foreign & Commonwealth Office building just off Trafalgar Square. If you go to Trafalgar Square then on to the Mall, there‚Äôs a long line of elegant buildings directly on the left after you go through Admiralty Arch. The ComCen was deep under there. I‚Äôm assuming the location isn‚Äôt covered by the Official Secrets Act (oops). It‚Äôs quite hard to find. I remember the first day I started. I had the address but couldn‚Äôt find the entrance. I even asked for directions from some policemen who were in the area and they didn‚Äôt have a clue where it was either. I had to ring the ComCen and get someone to come out and show me the entrance. It turned out to be quite an amazing place. During the long night shifts we would often go and explore the underground tunnels, built during World War II to connect Whitehall to the Houses of Parliament.</p>\n<p>Covent Garden is only a short walk from Trafalgar Square so when we finished the day shifts it would often be the start for a pub crawl. If it was good weather we‚Äôd also occasionally head down to one of the floating pub moored up on the Thames in Westminster.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/160aca2cd1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/160aca2cd1.jpg\" alt=\"Covent Garden\" title=\"Covent-garden-1\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1006\" /></a></p>\n<p>Again, I digress. We walked to Covent Garden with a quick detour past the Lamb and Flag pub - a favourite watering hole of Charles Dickens.</p>\n<p>Covent Garden wasn‚Äôt much different to how I remembered it. Steet artists plying their trade and pavement cafes serving over-priced drink.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d7270145f1.jpg\" alt=\"Covent Garden Charlie Chaplin\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We had a walk around the markets and paused for a while to watch a violin quintet entertaining the diners tucking into their Paella.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ee0a66585b.jpg\" alt=\"Giant Paella\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5af801bd13.jpg\" alt=\"Covent Garden violin quintet\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:10px;\" /></p>\n<p>While waiting for my parents to arrive we had a quick wander into the Covent Garden Apple Store - well you have to don‚Äôt you! Apple Stores are tourist attractions in their own right - each one an <a href=\"http://www.huftonandcrow.com/projects/gallery/apple-store-covent-garden/\">architectural work of art</a>.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dd673b79a8.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Store staircase\" style=\"float:left;margin:10px;\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d3f3c511b2.jpg\" alt=\"Covent Garden Apple Store\" style=\"float:left;margin:10px;\" /></p>\n<p>Once my parents arrived we had afternoon tea in Covent Garden and then spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in the West End. From Covent Garden we walked through Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, Chinatown and on to Regent St and Oxford St to do a bit of shopping, including a stop at Hamleys, the famous toy store, for Lauren.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/269589b659.jpg\" alt=\"Piccadilly Circus\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>I was determined to travel light for the trip. I did - too light. Hand-washing underwear in your hotel room is all well and good if you can then get them to dry. Sorry Rick Steves, I let you down, but in my defence travelling as light as I had started out was always going to be a problem with an itinerary like ours, which involved heat and 100% humidity, followed by a UK Autumn and then 0 degrees in the Swiss Alps. Layers, I know.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9b7cd35180.jpg\" alt=\"H&M London\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On the way back to our hotel we stopped for dinner at a Bella Italia restaurant on Queensway, which was so-so.</p>\n<h2>London Day 2</h2>\n<p>On day‚Äì2 (Wednesday) in London we picked up the Big Bus tour again near our hotel and stayed on it all the way around to the Tower of London. We passed too many sights to recount, again, a reminder that you could spend a year in London and not see everything.</p>\n<p>Once we got to the Tower we headed for a Costa Coffee and waited for my parents. Costa Coffee seems to have taken over the UK since I left, they‚Äôre everywhere. I used to like Costa Coffees and Starbucks before I came to Australia. I now know there‚Äôs a lot better coffee in the world. Australia has become renowned for its great cafes and baristas in the last few years, particularly Melbourne.</p>\n<p>We didn‚Äôt go in the Tower of London - that was planned for Friday. When my parents arrived we all took a cruise with <a href=\"http://www.citycruises.com/\">City Cruises</a> down to Westminster. That stretch of the river has some great sights including <a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/hms-belfast\">HMS Belfast</a> - a Town-class Cruiser that was one of the largest and most powerful British Cruisers during World War II. My uncle served on her during the late 50s. It‚Äôs now a museum administered by the Imperial War Museum. The trip down the river was made even more enjoyable by the pilot who looked like Captain Birdseye and whose commentary had us in stitches.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dc2f63124d.jpg\" alt=\"HMS Belfast\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On arrival at Westminster Pier we walked over Westminster Bridge and down the South Bank promenade past the London Eye.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/be25447b31.jpg\" alt=\"London Eye\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We stopped off for lunch at Wagamama and then had a look around <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern\">Tate Modern</a>. The major art galleries and museums in London are now subsidised by the government - meaning free entry. I‚Äôve been to Tate Britain before but this was my first time in Tate Modern.</p>\n<p>Outside Tate Modern there was a local school group reciting a passage from Shakespeare's The Temptest.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2992258e78.jpg\" alt=\"South Bank London\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>I have mixed feelings about modern art. Some of it is extraordinary and interesting. Some of it is pretentious nonsense.</p>\n<p>After the Tate Modern we walked across the Millennium Bridge (or the <a href=\"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Millennium_Bridge\">Death Eater Bridge</a> as it‚Äôs known to Lauren), designed by <a href=\"http://www.fosterandpartners.com/\">Sir Norman Foster</a>, to St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt have time to tour St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral as we had dinner plans.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/82bddee127.jpg\" alt=\"Millennium Bridge\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>That evening we went to <a href=\"http://www.searcyschampagnebars.co.uk/onenewchange-home.php\">Searcy‚Äôs Champagne Bar</a> for cocktails before having dinner at Jamie Oliver‚Äôs <a href=\"http://www.barbecoa.com/\">Barbecoa</a>. The meal was superb - possibly the best we had on the trip.</p>\n<h2>London Day 3</h2>\n<p>The third day in London, Thursday, was mad. This was the one day when there was no flexibility, I had pre-booked everything.</p>\n<p>It started with a tour of Buckingham Palace - one of the highlights of our trip. This was the first time we‚Äôd been inside. Talk about bling, I thought the Vatican was opulent. We took the audio tour through the State Rooms, which for this year only included the Jubilee Diamonds display. This was followed by a walk through the gardens.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e227c6e3d6.jpg\" alt=\"Buckingham Palace Gardens\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On completion of the tour we made it out just in time to catch the arse-end of the Changing of the Guards.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f4a86d4f81.jpg\" alt=\"Buckingham Palace 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We then headed along Birdcage Walk to Parliament Square. Rach and I had tickets for a tour of the Houses of Parliament while the grandparents took Lauren for some lunch. We spent a few minutes in Parliament Square before the tour, taking in our surroundings and admiring the statues of Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln.</p>\n<p>Parliament Square is a great starting-point for a tour of Westminster - between Westminster Bridge and Trafalgar Square. It starts with the statue of Boudicea riding her two-horse chariot - the Celtic warrior who refused to be Romanised. After Julius Caesar invaded and established Londinium, she lead a briefly successful revolt in A.D 60 after Roman soldiers raped her daughter. The revolt she led resulted in the slaughter of 60,000 Roman soldiers, but they were eventually overcome. Boudicea and her family took poison to avoid surrender.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bcb51f8227.jpg\" alt=\"Boudicea\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Looking across from Parliament you have St Margaret‚Äôs Church, often confused with Westminster Abbey by tourists. Westminster Abbey sits behind it. Whereas Westminster Abbey is the site for coronations and royal weddings, since 1480 St Margaret‚Äôs Church has been the place for politician‚Äôs weddings, including Winston Churchill‚Äôs marriage to Clementine.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the corner where Parliament Square meets Whitehall was the site for the world‚Äôs first traffic light in 1868. More recently, Parliament Square, along with Trafalgar Square, has been the focal point for many protests over the years, particularly in the last decade with the protests against the Iraq War.</p>\n<p>The HoP are only open at certain times of the year, when parliament is in recess. Luckily for us, the parliament was in recess for the party conference season.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38627de0cc.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The tour was fascinating. Commencing in the 900 yr old <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/westminsterhall/\">Westminster Hall</a>and then following the path the Queen takes during the State Opening of Parliament - from the grandeur of the House of Lords through to the relative slum that is the House of Commons. While we were in the HoP we spotted <a href=\"http://www.tanni.co.uk/\">Tanni Grey-Thompson</a>, now a member of the House of Lords. We also spotted <a href=\"http://www.mikeweatherleymp.com/2012/09/21/yngwie-malmsteen-visits-parliament-to-join-mikes-rock-the-house/\">Yngwie Malmsteen</a> (Swedish rock guitarist) being given a personal tour by a MP. I‚Äôll be honest, I had to look Yngwie up as I‚Äôd never heard of him.</p>\n<p>After the tour we walked up Whitehall to Trafalgar Square. I love walking Whitehall, there is so much to see and consider. You have the great ministries of state, including the Ministry of Defence and Treasury. There‚Äôs Downing St on the left of course, although these days there‚Äôs not much to see. You can‚Äôt even see the famous door of 10 Downing St from the iron gates. The last time Rach and I stood outside the gates we were interviewed by an American news crew. We were walking past Downing St and spotted a commotion with lots of TV cameras, so stopped to see what all the fuss was about. The next minute we had a microphone stuffed in our face asking what we thought of the news of the birth of the Prime Minster‚Äôs (Tony Blair) latest child. What can you say to that? I wanted to say ‚Äòwho cares‚Äô but I‚Äôm sad to admit I was much more diplomatic. I‚Äôve no idea if it was broadcast.</p>\n<p>In the middle of Whitehall you have the Cenotaph. I once took part in November Ceremonies as it‚Äôs called in the Navy - part of the Armed Forces guard that accompanies the Queen and other dignitaries who lay their wreaths during the 11th November ceremony to commemorate Armistice Day, also known as Remembrance Sunday. I was press-ganged into it due to an incident I had in Antwerp, Belgium a few months earlier. I‚Äôll save that story for another time.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ee3bf9a86e.jpg\" alt=\"Cenotaph\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Further up Whitehall you have Banqueting House on the right. A few years ago, shortly after leaving the Navy, I attended an IT vendor event at Banqueting House, without knowing the history of the place in which I was standing.</p>\n<p>Banqueting House is what‚Äôs left of Whitehall Palace - once the largest palace in Europe. Originally built for King Henry VIII and further extended over the years for other monarchs, including Elizabeth 1, Whitehall Palace once stretched from Trafalgar Square to the Houses of Parliament (Westminster Palace as it was then known).</p>\n<p>Today, you can stand facing Banqueting House and look up at the 1st floor windows to the site where, in 1649, King Charles 1 stepped out on to a wooden platform, uttered his final word ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù, before having his head chopped off at the orders of Oliver Cromwell. The history books tell us that the anti-monarchist Oliver Cromwell went on to become just as dictatorial and corrupted by wealth as the monarchs before him. A few years later he would succumb to infection and was buried at Westminster Abbey. Then ironically 12 years to the day after the execution of King Charles 1, Oliver Cromwell‚Äôs body was exhumed and posthumously executed - his severed head displayed on a pole outside Westminster Hall until 1685. There‚Äôs statues of both Charles 1 and Oliver Cromwell at either end of Whitehall.</p>\n<p>Before arriving at Trafalgar Square you also have Horse Guard Parade on the left, most recently the site for the London Olympics beach volleyball.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a4f4ac90aa.jpg\" alt=\"Horse Guards\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>At Trafalgar Square we met up my parents and Lauren. Trafalgar Square is, culturally and geographically, the centre of London. It‚Äôs a shame then that the authorities allow it to be spoiled by tacky crap. My photo‚Äôs of Trafalgar Squares are spoiled by the sighting of a <a href=\"http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/52237/be-open-sound-portal-an-acoustic-oasis-in-londons-trafalgar-square/#.UKhpSePZ8nE\">large black ‚Äòsound portal‚Äô </a> , put there for this year‚Äôs London Design Festival. Oh, and cranes. There seemed to be cranes everywhere. I found it really hard to get any photo‚Äôs of London that wasn‚Äôt spoilt by cranes protruding into my shots. How dare they carry out construction during my visit! Here's a shot that I took of the fourth plinth at Trafalgar Square that i like:</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c31cf5254d.jpg\" alt=\"Fourth Plinth Trafalgar Square\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>From Trafalgar Square we headed for our next appointment - afternoon tea at the National Portrait Gallery. It‚Äôs advertised as having views out over Trafalgar Square but in truth you can just about see the statue of Admiral Nelson on top of his column, you‚Äôre certainly not looking down at Trafalgar Square.</p>\n<p>You can‚Äôt come to London and not have Afternoon Tea! After stuffing ourselves with sandwiches and cake we took a brief tour of the highlights of the National Portrait Gallery. I particularly enjoyed the contemporary photographs.</p>\n<p>From there we walked back towards Covent Garden as we had tickets for The Lion King at the Lyceum Theatre. We were slightly early so went for a pint around the corner at the <a href=\"http://fancyapint.com/Pub/london/lyceum-tavern/611\">Lyceum Tavern</a>.</p>\n<p>A trip to London is not complete without taking in a West End show. When deciding on which show to see my first choice would have been Les Miserables. However, we have an 11yr old daughter and given that we would be spending much of our time in London dragging her round from one historic sight to the next, we figured we‚Äôd let her choose the show, as long as her grandparents were happy with the selection of course. She chose The Lion King.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve never seen the film of The Lion King so went into it with no clue of the story line. My only knowledge of The Lion King was Elton John belting out The Circle of Life. I had an open mind and gave it a go, but it wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea. It‚Äôs a spectacular production but within 30 mins of it starting, all the walking and fresh air got the better of me and I dropped off. Ok, the beer might have had something to do with it too. I still couldn‚Äôt tell you what the story is about. Everyone else enjoyed it though.</p>\n<p>Our original itinerary was for the grandparents to take Lauren home after the show while Rach and I hit the West End, possibly to a comedy club or Jazz club. That was wishful thinking. Maybe when we were in our twenties we could have handled it but after the show there was only one place we were heading - Bedfordshire. I think I was asleep before my head hit the pillow.</p>\n<h2>London Day 4</h2>\n<p>We had one final set of tickets to use for our last day in London before driving up north to see the in-laws in Doncaster. After popping to see my uncle in Ladbroke Grove (who my parents were staying with), and then having a very cheap (by Brisbane standards) but hearty breakfast at the nearby Sainsbury‚Äôs cafe, we took a bus and then tube back over to Tower Hill to pick up our tickets for a tour of the Tower.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been inside the <a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/\">Tower of London</a> before, as had Rach, but it was many years ago and we knew this would be something that Lauren would enjoy. To be fair, she had shown an interest wherever we had visited. She showed a lot more interest and patience for history and art than I‚Äôm sure I did at her age. Even so, a guided tour by the Wardens (beefeaters) telling stories of the gruesome murders and executions that took place at the Tower is always good fun for the kiddies (and adults).</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/15501111fc.jpg\" alt=\"Tower of London\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The tour was as entertaining as I remembered. After the tour we spent some time visiting the Crown Jewels, White Tower and the Royal Armouries exhibition.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/be36fb3082.jpg\" alt=\"Tower of London\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On completion of our visit to the Tower we headed back to pick up our cases so we could try and get a head start on the Friday afternoon traffic heading north. Unfortunately however, we had left it a little late and ended up spending 5 hours on the A1.</p>\n<p>We had packed a lot into our 3 and half days in London but there was still a bunch of places on our original itinary that we didn‚Äôt manage to fit in. At least we would have another chance when we later returned from Paris before our flight out of Heathrow to Hong Kong three weeks later.</p>\n",

Perhaps it was subconscious anxiety about the trip - a worry that it might no go perfectly to plan.

Well that was the plan. We got there shortly after 8am only to find it was shut. Perhaps it only opens for breakfast on the weekends? We‚Äôve only ever been on the weekends before.</p>\n<p>So then we went to Raby Bay only to find the restaurants and cafes were all shut there too. We ended up at the Coffee Club at Capalaba Park mall. Not exactly the views we were after but the breakfast did manage to sort out my minor hangover from the work End of Financial Year party the night before.</p>\n<p>We had a day flight, leaving on a Qantas Boeing 747 to Singapore. It was the first time that we had flown with Qantas and I was pleasantly surprised. The food, leg-room, entertainment system, all good, no complaints.</p>\n<p>We had booked into the <a href=\"http://www.rwsentosa.com/language/en-US/Hotels/HardRockHotel\">Hard Rock Hotel</a> on Sentosa Island, which is part of <a href=\"http://www.rwsentosa.com/\">Resorts World Sentosa</a>.</p>\n<p>Resorts World Sentosa is a mega-resort that opened in 2010 and is home to integrated hotels, casino, Universal Studios, Marine Life Park, and a number of other attractions that are all inter-connected across the island by monorail and cable car.</p>\n<p>We arrived at our hotel early evening. We‚Äôve been to Singapore a few times now but never fail to be surprised by the 100% humidity that slaps you in the face as you emerge from the air-conditioned cocoon of the airport or hotel. Brisbane is sub-tropical so the humidity is high most of the year, but it‚Äôs nothing compared to Singapore, or most of South-East Asia for that matter. I couldn‚Äôt imagine living in those conditions year-round. No wonder much of South-East Asia is one air-conditioned mall after the next.</p>\n<p>Another characteristic of Singapore is the grey skies. I don't think I've ever been to Singapore and seen the sun. The humidity causes a permanent haze over the island which, unfortunately, is not very good for the photographs. The grey skies are deceiving - you can still get sunburnt within minutes, as we found to our cost on a previous visit.</p>\n<p>The hotel was pretty snazzy, with reminders that you‚Äôre staying in a Hard Rock hotel everywhere - from the pictures of Jimmy Hendrix on the wall to the toiletries in the bathroom presented in a mini guitar box. Of course, there‚Äôs also an Hard Rock Cafe and the obligatory Hard Rock shop.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7376383f9a.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel room\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-5.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4b24590014.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel bathroom\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-6.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After checking out the room we headed out to explore the resort. The hotel is directly adjacent to FestiveWalk which has a plethora of restaurants, shops, fountains and bright lights leading up to the Merlion.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/baf1243dac.jpg\" alt=\"FestiveWalk Sentosa\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"festive-walk.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/277aa20761.jpg\" alt=\"Merlion - Singapore\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"merlion-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The intention of our weekend on Sentosa was to start the holiday off with a bit of relaxation before the madness of the city visits ahead. The next day (Saturday) fully lived up to the billing. Lauren was in her element thanks to the hotel‚Äôs large pool with lots of nooks and crannies for her to explore. Rach and I were also sorted thanks to the swim-up bar and the lovely cocktails. God knows how many Mojitos and Singapore Slings I got through that weekend.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/73431547d6.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel pool\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-1.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6901ea5139.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel pool bar\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The following day we had tickets to the Universal Studios theme park. We expected to spent most of the day there but we were finished by early afternoon. I know theme parks grow over time and this one is new, but when you‚Äôve been to the Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, this is like going to a school fair by comparison.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/391e2f2073.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Studios Singapore\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"universal-studios-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>To enhance the experience we had purchased express passes to allow us to skip to the front of the lines. It adds more expense to the day but it‚Äôs definitely worth it - queuing for an hour in 100% humidity for a ride that lasts 60 seconds is not my idea of fun.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c004711956.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Studios\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"universal-studios-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Lauren had a great time and there were a few rides that we all loved, but in general, I would say the theme parks on the Gold Coast 40mins from our house are just as good, if not better.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ff1fd473c2.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Studios\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"universal-studios-3.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4b698d9303.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Studios\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"universal-studios-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The good thing about Universal Studios it it‚Äôs only a short walk back to our hotel, so back to the pool we went.</p>\n<p>In the evenings we sampled some of the restaurants. On the Saturday night we went to an American Blues bar which promised Cajun food and live Blues music. The food was bland and they did that thing of bringing the starters and mains out at the same time, which is always a bit bizarre for non-asian food. On the Sunday evening we went to a restaurant specialising in local cuisine. This was better but nothing to write home about.</p>\n<p>After eating we walked around FestiveWalk. The lights and the music result in a nice buzz to the place in the evening, but it wasn't long before the humidity would leave us in a sweaty mess and wanting to retreat back to the hotel bar and air-conditioning. Luckily the hotel bar made some fantastic cocktails.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/feab7b236e.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel cocktail bar\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Monday was our final day on Sentosa. In the morning we took the monorail over to the other side of the island (less than 10 mins) to check out the beach area. Strangely the place was deserted. I‚Äôve no idea why no one was around. There‚Äôs a few more hotels and attractions on that side of the island. Perhaps the hotel guests prefer to stay around the pool than head to the beach.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6c03dc567e.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa beach\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"sentosa-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After taking a paddle we decided to have a go at one of the attractions before heading back. There were a few to choose from but as soon as we saw it our minds were made up - Segways! It was our first time on a Segway. What fun. Afterwards we all said the same thing - I want one!</p>\n<p>I remember when the Segway was first announced on the news a few years ago. The announcement was that tomorrow a revolutionary invention would be unveiled that would change the world. Mmm, it‚Äôs not quite had the impact that the inventors expected but it really is a fantastic piece of machinery. It doesn‚Äôt take long at all to get the hang of it and the gyroscope makes it virtually impossible to fall off. I was leaning forwards as far as possible to try and make it go faster but there was never any danger of completely toppling over.</p>\n<p>The price of the Segway means that it‚Äôs currently limited to the odd tourist company and urban police, such as <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/101305127329503814686/albums/5632863371622921937/5632864394406518114?authkey=CNuvtJbEpOumZQ\">this one</a> I spotted while I was in Omaha in the US. Hopefully one day the economies of scale will finally be reached so that we can all afford one. I can‚Äôt see that happening any time soon though. Perhaps a good thing considering the obesity epidemic in the western world.</p>\n<p>After tearing around an off-road track on a Segway we took the monorail back to FestiveWalk, where we enjoyed one final attraction before heading back to the hotel - the Sentosa Cable Car over the island, across to the Singapore mainland and back.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ea7c17dc22.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa Cable Car\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"sentosa-6.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5028c55b63.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa Cable Car\" style=\"margin:5px;border:0;\" title=\"sentosa-4.jpg\" />\n<br style=\"clear:both;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1b7aa4833a.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa \" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"sentosa-5.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/af04664d4a.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa looking to Singapore mainland\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"sentosa-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>We had a late flight Monday evening so I asked reception if we could get a late check-out. They obliged by extending it from 12pm to 1pm - not quite the late check-out I had in mind. It didn‚Äôt really matter though. We were able to use the locker room facilities next to the pool so that we could have one final afternoon around the pool and get a shower and change of clothes before leaving for the airport.</p>\n<p>Sentosa Island was a great start to the trip and is a fantastic purpose-built family holiday destination. We visited at the right time of the year - mid September. It was fairly quiet which meant no fighting for a sun-bed or a seat at the swim-up bar. It was bliss! I‚Äôd highly recommend Sentosa if you‚Äôre visiting Singapore, it makes a nice contrast to the wall-to-wall malls on the mainland.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8e45f5a95f.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"sentosa-1.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e2a587df17.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel cocktail\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-4.jpg\" /></p>\n",

When it came to it however, the itinerary was that packed that for the first 3 weeks there was not a single hour spare to sit down and do some writing, and for the final week I was simply too exhausted to care.</p>\n<div class=\"in-post-widget\">\n<h3>Trip Series Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/942/europe-trip-2012-part-1\">Part 1: The Planning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/970/europe-trip-2012-part-2-sentosa-island\">Part 2: Sentosa Island</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1002/europe-trip-2012-part-3-london\">Part 3: London</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1031/europe-trip-2012-part-4-family-and-friends\">Part 4: Friends and Family</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1049/europe-trip-2012-part-4-venice\">Part 5: Venice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1066/europe-trip-2012-part-6-grindelwald\">Part 6: Grindelwald</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1108/europe-trip-2012-part-7-paris\">Part 7: Paris</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2930/europe-trip-2012-part-8-london-hong-kong-home\">Part 8: London - Hong Kong - Home</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>The Planning</h2>\n<p>After the disaster which was our honeymoon in Nov 2010 (I never covered it on here, it was too depressing), we decided our next overseas trip would be back to the UK. After all, we emigrated here in May 2007 and hadn‚Äôt been back once, whereas in that time our parents had visited us twice.</p>\n<p>We knew that we would need a month - flying to the other side of the world and coming back just two weeks later is no fun. We also knew that we would want to use the opportunity to see Europe, and not just our home towns of Worksop and Doncaster. Four weeks in Worksop and Doncaster is not my idea of a holiday.</p>\n<p>We began saving. We told ourselves that we would make the most of the trip and although we wouldn‚Äôt go mad, it wouldn‚Äôt be a budget holiday either; the itinerary would dictate the budget not the other way round.</p>\n<p>We worked out rough dates. We wanted Lauren to miss as little school as possible, but at the same time we wanted to travel at an optimal time taking into account cost and weather conditions. The summer school holidays in Australia run from Christmas through to the end of January. We briefly considered booking for Christmas 2011 but it was only a fleeting thought. It‚Äôs one of the busiest times for travelling so we knew that flights and hotels would be expensive, even if we booked well in advance. Plus, it would be Winter. Maybe Christmas in Finland is magical but that‚Äôs not the term I‚Äôd use to describe December in the UK!</p>\n<p>We considered Jun/Jul/Aug this year. It was a great summer for London and the UK in general with the Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics, but as a visitor I didn‚Äôt fancy the extra crowds and expense that would inevitably ensue. Also, I get really bad hayfever during the UK summers, a condition that I really don‚Äôt miss.</p>\n<p>We finally decided on Sep/Oct 2012. It would tie in with half-term so Lauren wouldn‚Äôt have to miss too much school, and all the travel books recommend visiting the major cities during the shoulder months either side of summer. We could have gone during the European spring this year but Sept would give us a bit more time to save.</p>\n<h2>Flight Booking</h2>\n<p>With that decided we set about looking for flights. I haven‚Äôt used a travel agent since the 90‚Äôs. With Tripadvisor, flight comparison sites, travel forums, etc, who needs them? Again, the brief we gave ourself was that the flight must be a good compromise between affordability and the inclusion of stopovers somewhere nice. In the three trips we did to Australia from Europe, including emigrating, we always had a stopover. For one, it‚Äôs a chance to see a different part of the world, and two, the flight through to the other side of the world is a killer if, like me, you have problems sleeping or airplanes.</p>\n<p>We ideally wanted stopovers in places we haven‚Äôt visited before. That ruled out Singapore, Dubai and Los Angeles - perhaps the most common stopovers between the UK and Australia. I really fancied visiting San Francisco and Seattle. When I looked into it though all the flights from Brisbane pretty much go via LA, first requiring flight changes to SF or Seattle, so it would have been expensive and would have added a fair few hours to the travelling time. We‚Äôre saving San Francisco and Seattle up for a future trip. We‚Äôd like to drive the west coast of America from San Francisco up to Seattle and then over the border to Vancouver.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, after much research we found affordable flights with Qantas and British Airways. I say surprisingly because usually they‚Äôre amongst the dearest with Singapore Airlines and Emirates being the cheapest. We settled on Singapore on the way out and Hong Kong on the way back. Yes we have been to Singapore before (this would be my third time) but we would make this time different by staying on Sentosa Island.</p>\n<p>I spent countless hours researching every aspect of this trip and the lessons I learnt from booking these flights were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We get ripped off in Australia. It‚Äôs often nearly twice as dear to fly from Australia to Europe as it is the other way round.</li>\n<li>Just because you live in Australia (or any other country for that matter) you don‚Äôt have to book flights using websites in your own country. We got our flights cheapest using <a href=\"http://www.orbitz.com\">orbitz.com</a>. The site I recommend now for flight comparisons is <a href=\"http://www.hipmunk.com\">hipmunk.com</a>.</li>\n<li>The earlier you book the better. You can get some bargains closer to the date but in general flights are cheapest when they first become available.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Itinerary</h2>\n<p>With the flights booked and the dates of travel locked in the next step was to determine our itinerary. This is something that evolved over time right up until leaving. Hotels can generally be cancelled without charge up to 24 hours before the arrival time (unless you get a deal which doesn‚Äôt allow cancellation without charge), nevertheless, once we decided on a place we stuck to it. The only exception was the hotel on Sentosa Island - I later managed to find a good deal at what we thought was a better hotel.</p>\n<p>London was on the list. We both love London and it‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve been. I lived in London for 6 months during my time in the Navy but you could spend a year in London and not see everything. Also, it‚Äôs a vibrant world-class city that never stands still and I wanted Lauren to experience it. We took her as a small child but she can‚Äôt remember it.</p>\n<p>Also on the list was Venice. We both love Italy. Our last trip to Italy was a few years ago when we enjoyed a fantastic long weekend in Rome courtesy of a cheap flight with Ryan Air. Those cheap European flights is something we‚Äôve really missed since emigrating. I visited Italy countless times during my Navy years but never really appreciated it. I was young and stupid and in those days judged a place by the quality of its pub crawl.</p>\n<p>I visited Trieste in Italy about 5 times when I was in the Navy. Trieste is roughly a 90 min drive from Venice but I never ventured over to Venice because I made a promise to my girlfriend at the time (who was to become my first wife) that I wouldn‚Äôt go to Venice without her. In fairness this was because the first time my ship had planned to visit Trieste I made arrangements to take shore leave and spend a few days in Venice with her - arriving on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Due to operational reasons the ship couldn‚Äôt make it to Trieste and I had to ring her at the last minute to tell her to cancel it. This happened a lot in the Navy and was one of many reasons that I left after 7 and a half years - you couldn‚Äôt plan anything.</p>\n<p>My first trip to Italy after leaving the Navy was with Rachelle when we got a cheap Ryan Air flight to Rimini for a couple of days. It was out of season but it was a completely different experience to my time in the Navy. We instantly fell in love with Italian culture and particularly the cuisine.</p>\n<p>Also on the list was Paris. My only previous trip to France was to Bordeaux, again during the Navy. My only memory of Bordeaux is getting very drunk, leaving a nightclub on my own and getting lost trying to find my way back to the ship. After walking in the wrong direction for 2 hours, in my inebriated state I managed a ‚Äúo√π est le maritime‚Äù to someone in a Shell petrol station who finally directed me in the right direction. I didn‚Äôt have enough money for a taxi.</p>\n<p>Rachelle had visited Paris as a teenager during one of her many French exchange visits. She didn‚Äôt like it at the time and had a panic attack under the Eiffel Tower. She was in no rush to re-visit but I managed to convince her that you can‚Äôt judge a place by your experience as a teenager. As it happens her visit to Paris this time only went as far as the Eiffel Tower, but I‚Äôll come to that later.</p>\n<p>Of course, we wanted to spend a good amount of time with family and friends so we needed to factor that into the equation. A good chunk of the visit would be spent in the UK but we also saw this as an opportunity to visit a few places in the UK which we had never got around to visiting previously.</p>\n<p>Finally, we realised the itinerary was looking very city-heavy, so we wanted to go somewhere completely different to break it up a little.</p>\n<p>I already had in mind that I‚Äôd like to travel between Venice and Paris via rail. I like travelling by rail in Europe. I hold quite a fondness for rail travel as it was my main method of transport during my time in the navy (besides ships of course) - I didn‚Äôt sit my driving test until I left the Navy. If only Queensland Rail were as clean, fast, efficient and comfortable as the trains in Europe.</p>\n<p>I took a look at the rail routes between Venice and Paris, and straight away the Swiss Alps jumped out at me as an ideal mid-point. I remember reading an article a while ago about the Bernini Express and had dreamt about gliding through the Alps with snow-capped mountains on either side ever since.</p>\n<p>After more research and discussions with Rach we settled on the small town of Grindelwald near Interlaken, in the Jungfrau region of Switzerland. This would be my first time to Switzerland (it‚Äôs land-locked).</p>\n<h2>Rail Bookings in Europe</h2>\n<p>Benefit from my many hours of research into rail travel in Europe and know this - do not book via RailEurope.com. You can get much cheaper tickets booking directly with the rail companies that you will be travelling with.</p>\n<p>We purchased our tickets between Venice and Grindelwald through TrenItalia and the Grindelwald to Paris tickets were purchased through SBB. For some reason SBB didn‚Äôt offer e-tickets for part of the journey so we had to get them delivered. It was much cheaper to get them delivered to our parent‚Äôs house in the UK than delivered to Australia - if I remember right the delivery charge would have been 50% of the ticket price to Australia</p>\n<p>After Grindelwald and Paris the plan was then to take the Eurostar back to London to catch our flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong for a few days, and then home to Brisbane.</p>\n<h2>Rick Steves Europe Guides</h2>\n<p>We had a rough itinerary worked out: Brisbane > Sentosa Island > London > Doncaster/Worksop > other UK places TBD > Venice > Grindelwald > Paris > London > Hong Kong > Brisbane.</p>\n<p>The planning for this trip started last December - a good nine months before we were to travel. This doesn‚Äôt sound like much but to me it was a lifetime. I‚Äôm used to being spontaneous and getting last minute deals.</p>\n<p>I then discovered a new hobby - reading travel guides! I‚Äôve always been a fan of Lonely Plan travel guides but I‚Äôve finally discovered <a href=\"http://www.ricksteves.com/\">Rick Steves</a>. Now I live in Australia I shop through amazon.com rather than amazon.co.uk - they haven‚Äôt launched amazon.com.au yet, unfortunately. Being targeted at American readers, Rick Steves travel guides never came across my radar when I used to purchase travel guides from amazon.co.uk.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend Rick Steves travel guides to anyone who is planning a trip to Europe. His guides are much more personal than the Lonely Planet ones and contain a lot of practical advice. He also has a number of free video and audio podcasts that I found invaluable for the planning, and great audio guides to use when visiting the sights.</p>\n<p>My planning for this trip wasn‚Äôt limited to reading the travel guides and spending time on the travel forums (mainly Tripadvisor and Fodors). My 2012 New Year‚Äôs Resolutions were focused on this trip. To get the most out of it I pledged to a) learn photography and b) study European art, history and literature related to the places we would be visiting. On the first count I didn‚Äôt do too bad, although you might think otherwise when you see my Hong Kong photos (I had my camera on the wrong settings). On the second count I‚Äôd give myself a grade of C. I did learn a fair bit but as much as I‚Äôd like to think of myself as a ‚Äòlearned fellow‚Äô, the truth is I can only get halfway through one of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays before flicking to a Chris Ryan book. Reading about a piece of art is much more interesting when you‚Äôre actually standing in front of it. To paraphrase Robin William‚Äôs character in Good Will Hunting - reading about the Sistine Chapel isn‚Äôt the same as smelling it.</p>\n<p>Using the Rick Steves guides, in consultation with Rach I worked out rough interaries for our days in London, Paris and Venice. I figured I would be more flexible for the other places.</p>\n<p>So, after many months of research and planning we were ready to go. The final itinerary looked like this: Brisbane > Sentosa Island > London > Doncaster/Worksop > Cotswolds > Bath > Longleat House & Safari Park > Doncaster/Worksop > Harry Potter Movie Studios (on the way to the Airport) > Venice > Grindelwald > Paris > London > Hong Kong > Home.</p>\n",

One of the features of TriggerTrap is the ability to take time-lapse photos. I had a go at this recording the sunset shadow slowly setting over Brisbane - approximately 1 photo every minute. Unfortunately I soon got bored stood there next to the camera while the app did its work and only took 16 shots of time-lapse photos. When that converts to a 25 fps HD video it comes out at less than a second. Next time I'll take a chair with me and some warm clothing and do it properly.</p>\n",

We haven't been to <a href=\"http://www.ekka.com.au\">Queensland's largest annual event</a> since 2007 so we thought it was about time we gave it another try. We had a really good day. The Woolworths Fresh Food Pavilion may have had something to do with that, what with the countless wine-tasting stands and assorted gourmet food outlets. A few of my photo's from the day are shown above.</p>\n",

It‚Äôs easy to label people and I may not agree with their politics but they were absolutely lovely people. They couldn‚Äôt have been more hospitable.</p>\n<p>Being brought up the right way I was a good tourist, respecting their culture and happy to absorb myself in the local customs. I do genuinely enjoy shooting and jumped at the chance when our hosts offered to take us to their local gun club for a shoot. I had to bite my tongue though when they showed me their gun cabinet at home and brought out 9mm and .45mm pistols, as well as an AR‚Äì15 assault rifle.</p>\n<p>Being able to go to a shooting club and let off a little steam is one thing, walking around ‚Äòpacking heat‚Äô or riding in your car with an assault rifle in your boot is entirely another. It‚Äôs not 1836 anymore. The west has been tamed. If the mexicans attempt to invade I‚Äôm pretty sure the US armed forces and border police can handle it. This conspiracy theory that citizens should bear arms to keep the government at bay is ridiculous. For one thing, I‚Äôm pretty confident the government would win - they have much bigger guns.</p>\n<p>‚ÄòGuns don‚Äôt kill people, people kill people‚Äô, is the common argument amongs the NRA and other pro-gun lobbies - ignoring the mass of data that shows there‚Äôs a clear correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths. Last year guns accounted for 9484 deaths in America, as opposed to 468 for Australia, UK, Germany and Canada combined.</p>\n<p>Of course there‚Äôs always anomolies. There‚Äôs been mass shootings in the UK and the recent massacre in Norway by Anders Behring Breivik, both in countries with tough gun-control laws. Some people are just insane and if they want to find ways to commit mass murder they will. That‚Äôs no argument for saying gun control doesn‚Äôt work though.</p>\n<p>The fact is, the data shows that if you have a gun in your home or are around people who owns a gun you‚Äôre more likely to be a victom of gun-related violence or accidents. In countries with strict gun-laws there‚Äôs less people that have guns and less gun-related violence. It‚Äôs not rocket science.</p>\n<p>I fully support the right of people to enjoy the sport of shooting but that doesn‚Äôt mean you need to keep a gun at home. Go to a licenced shooting club which keeps the guns under lock and key.</p>\n<p>Nothing will change after yesterday‚Äôs shooting at the Batman opening in Aurora, Colorado. Nothing changed after the Columbine shooting, the Tuscon shooting, or any of the countless other massacres that have took place in America. Certainly nothing will change this year as it‚Äôs an election year. Any candidate that tries to bring up such a deeply divisive issue will just get accused of playing politics.</p>\n<p>The opinion in Australia regarding gun-control used to be pretty split before the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_(Australia)\">Port Arthur massacre</a> in 1996. The aftermath of that trajedy resulted in strict gun laws and the destruction of 700,000 privately owned firearms. Between 1996 and 2003 the <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=1502\">risk of dying by gunshot halved</a>. But that‚Äôs Australia, not America. Australia didn‚Äôt have the 2nd amendment. As long as 49% of Americans continue to believe that the 2nd amendment is still relevant today nothing will change.</p>\n",

Australia dominated rugby (both codes) and cricket, they were way far ahead of GB in the medals tables at the Olympics, and in Feb 2003 the Socceroos even beat England at football in that disastrous game at Upton Park in which Harry Kewell dominated and England lost 3‚Äì1.</p>\n<p>Boy are things different now. England may still be shit at football but in other sports GB has world-beaters across the board. Just look at golf where as of today, Luke Donald, Rory Mcllroy and Lee Westwood are ranked 1, 2 and 3 respectively in the <a href=\"http://www.officialworldgolfranking.com/rankings/default.sps\">world rankings</a>, and England‚Äôs test cricket team is world number one.</p>\n<p>For the aussies it came as a bit of a shock when GB finally beat them in the medals table in the Beijing Olympics. (19‚Äì14 in Golds and 47‚Äì46 overall), and that will almost certainly continue this year in London. A country‚Äôs medal count always gets a boost when they are the host nation, and Team GB have made certain that the trend will continue after an investment of $469 (AUD) million (¬£312 million) in the last 4 years, double that of the green and gold, and more than any other nation from the 205 competing.</p>\n<p>The sitting-down events (cycling, rowing, sailing) gave Team GB the most success in Beijing. That is set to continue in London but there‚Äôs also real hopes for the likes of Tom Daley (diving), Mo Farah (5000m/1000m), and Jessica Ennis (heptathlon), amongst many others.</p>\n<p>For the Aussies, swimming will continue to be the best hope of medals. I for one will be cheering on local girl Stephanie Rice, hoping she can repeat the haul of 3 golds that she won in Beijing. Outside the pool Sally Pearson is exciting to watch and as long as she doesn‚Äôt slip up like <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-15/pearson-suffers-loss-at-crystal-palace/4131260\">she did at Crystal Palace</a> she‚Äôs a good bet for gold in the 100m hurdles. Besides that there‚Äôs also high hopes in a number of events, including men‚Äôs hockey, sailing, and rowing.</p>\n<p>On the 14th August, myself, Rach and Lauren will finally swear the oath as Australian citizens. That will give us dual citizenship. Between team GB and team Australia it looks like we‚Äôre going to have plenty of opportunity to sing alone to Advance Australia Fair or God Save the Queen.</p>\n",

Objectives once deemed indispensable, such as nation-building and counterinsurgency, have been abandoned or downgraded, either because they haven‚Äôt worked or because there‚Äôs no longer enough time to achieve them. Even the education of girls, a signal achievement of the NATO presence in Afghanistan, is at risk. By the end of 2014, when the last Americans are due to stop fighting, the Taliban will not be defeated. A Western-style democracy will not be in place. The economy will not be self-sustaining. No senior Afghan official will likely be imprisoned for any crime, no matter how egregious. And it‚Äôs a good bet that, in some remote mountain valley, even Al Qaeda, which brought the United States to Afghanistan in the first place, will be carrying on.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/07/09/120709fa_fact_filkins?currentPage=all\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/07/09/120709fa_fact_filkins?currentPage=all</a></p>\n",

Gold Coast which I booked with <a href=\"http://goldcoastphototours.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Deluxe Coastal Photo Tours</a>. When I started to plan our upcoming trip back to Europe I set myself a number of objectives to make the most out of the trip, one of which was to learn photography.<p>This will be our first trip back since emigrating in 2007 and it's set to be epic. Besides time in our home towns visting family and friends, our itinerary includes London, Bath, Oxford and the Cotswolds in the UK; Venice; Grindelwald in the Swiss Alps; and Paris. We also have stopovers on Sentosa Island, Singapore on the way out, and Hong Kong on the way back. With that itinerary in mind I've been determined to take my Canon DSLR off automatic settings and learn what I need to in order to capture the best memories from the trip.</p>\n<p>Up until now my main methods of learning have been from YouTube videos, podcasts, magazines and photography websites. Then the other week we were watching <a href=\"http://www.greatsoutheast.com.au/gsec2cqw/week.asp?programID=1&amp;viewMode=thisWeek\" target=\"_blank\">The Great South East</a> on Channel 7 which included a feature on the full day Gold Coast photo tour. I immediately booked a spot.</p>\n<p>At $99 this tour is excellent value. It was a very early start getting to Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast for the scheduled 6am kick-off. Burleigh Heads is at the southern tip of the Gold Coast, roughly a 80 min drive from home. The day started a beach Sunrise session. Unfortunately for us the weather has been crap lately and the clouds put pay to any dramatic sunrise shots.</p>\n<p>After the beach session we went for breakfast which included a post-processing workshop using Adobe Lightroom. I've dabbled with Photoshop but i'm completely new to Lightroom so I found this really useful. Despite the weather which resulted in poor light conditions I think I managed to produce a few decent photo's, the best of which are above.</p>\n<p>After breakfast we went to Natural Bridge in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springbrook_National_Park\" target=\"_blank\">Springbrook National Park</a>. I had never visited this part of the Gold Coast hinterland before and found it to be¬†break-taking, again, despite the crappy weather.</p>\n<p>A photo session here was followed by a picnic lunch and another change to do some more post-processing.</p>\n<p>All in all the day was a great opportunity to put into practice some of the techniques I've been learning in an environment where I could get help and support from the tour organisers and fellow learners.</p>\n",

I've <a href=\"http://darylhaines.com/s/photographyphotography?format=original\" title=\"Photography\">started to learn photography</a> so I wanted a new theme which would better complement my pics.\nI'd like to say I designed this site myself, but alas, I haven't got the time or inclination to design a site from scratch. For that speak to my mate Damien at the award-winning Propeller Design -¬†<a href=\"http://www.propellerglobal.com/web-design\">http://www.propellerglobal.com/web-design</a></p>\n<p>No, I purchased a Wordpress theme I liked from themeforest.com that ticked all my boxes - i.e, clean design, compatible; SEO optimised; flexible layout, etc.</p>\n<p>It's a responsive design, meaning that it should look good irrespective of whether you view this on your PC/Mac, iPad or iPhone (other tablets/smartphones are available, but seriously, why would you?).</p>\n<p>I also designed a basic logo to match the theme using Photoshop.</p>\n<p>All feedback welcome.</p>\n",

There‚Äôs no chance of England getting any further than the quarter-finals in a major tournament until they change their entire approach to the game.\nWith the right manager who can instil confident, attacking football they may have a chance to reach the semi‚Äôs. To win the competition though they would need to beat Spain; a team that has re-defined how football should be played.</p>\n<h2 id=\"posessionposessionposession.\">Possession, Possession, Possession.</h2>\n<p>Spain understand that the key to winning is possession, every time.</p>\n<p>Have you noticed how Spain hardly ever loft a ball into the penalty box directly from a corner? To most of us that might seem a wasted opportunity to attack the goal. To Spain, a corner is an opportunity to lose possession of the ball. That‚Äôs why they nearly always play it out. They know that corner kicks can result in, at best, a 50% chance of winning the ball, and those odds aren‚Äôt good enough. They know that to create an opportunity and score they need to have possession of the ball, so keeping the ball comes above everything else.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a numbers game. England may have the passion (or used to at least), but Spain have the brains. It‚Äôs like watching a game of chess. They constantly probe their opponents defence looking for weaknesses. They rarely shoot from out of the box because the odds aren‚Äôt good enough. Like a corner, long shots are merely opportunities to lose possession. Even on the edge of the penalty box they only shoot if they know they have good odds of scoring. That‚Äôs why they get accused of trying to walk the ball into the box.</p>\n<p>Spain doesn‚Äôt have the best defence in the world. They don‚Äôt need to. Their form of defence is keeping possession of the ball. Just look at the stats. They conceded only one goal in Euro 2012 and only 6 in the last three major tournaments combined. They stack their side with midfielders in every position because these are the players who are best at keeping the ball.</p>\n<p>It was telling that in the final of Euro 2012 they didn‚Äôt start with any recognisable strikers. It‚Äôs not just because they‚Äôve got outstanding midfielders in the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, and Fabregas who are all capable of scoring goals. It‚Äôs because their form of possession football means that sooner or later they know they‚Äôre going to get an opportunity where any one of the outfield players can score.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canenglandchange\">Can England Change</h2>\n<p>So the question is, can and should the England team change the way they play to match Spain‚Äôs winning formula?</p>\n<p>Most pundits don‚Äôt think to seem it‚Äôs possible. I was watching the Twitter feed when England lost to Italy and I noticed Michael Owen tweet that people should stop saying that England should play like Spain as England aren‚Äôt capable of playing that kind of possession football.</p>\n<p>Is this really true? He would know better than me but surely if England have any hope of winning a major tournament they should at least consider it. It‚Äôs not going to happen overnight. England‚Äôs players all play in the Premier League which is known for fast-paced, exciting football; which, as a by-product, does not necessarily result in a high percentage of possession for the winning side. Also, when foreign managers from La Liga come to the Premier League they tend to adopt the style played in the Premier League rather than change to the style favoured by Barcelona and Spain.</p>\n<p>In my view, for England to start playing possession football it would need 1) to start in the academies, both at a club and national level, and 2) require more English players to play in foreign leagues, particularly La Liga. Whilst the EPL is full of foreign players there‚Äôs only a handful of English players that have made the jump to foreign leagues.</p>\n<p>With the right manager and players could England win a major tournament playing the English way? Perhaps. Spain have a recipe for success but it doesn‚Äôt always get the right result. After all, Portugal beat Spain 4‚Äì0 in 2010. So does that undermine my argument? I don‚Äôt think so. There‚Äôs always going to be anomalies in a game where form, fitness, conditions and importantly, luck, play a role. The exception doesn‚Äôt disprove the rule.</p>\n<p>With Harry Redknapp in charge you would like to think that England would have had more confidence to keep attacking the opposition as opposed to playing defensively to protect their lead - the tactic that failed miserably in Euro 2012. Harry Redknapp could have got them to the final. They still wouldn‚Äôt have beaten Spain though.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I love <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/\">Tom Cruise</a>. There, I‚Äôve said it.\nThe break-up of Tom-Kat seems to have sparked another round of Tom Cruise bashing in the media. I really don‚Äôt understand the crazy tag that got assigned to him after jumping on Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs sofa. Why was that such a big deal? What‚Äôs wrong with showing a bit of passion?</p>\n<p>The other area of criticism is his belief in Scientology. Critics deride this as a cult. They‚Äôre probably right, but to me so is Christianity; both involve a heaped tablespoon of delusion. Scientology is all about the money they say. Really, and Christianity isn‚Äôt? I‚Äôve been to that blinged-up palace of opulence that they call The Vatican. According to the bible ‚ÄòIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.‚Äô (Mark 10:25). Tell that to those evangelical TV preachers or the Vatican‚Äôs bank manager.</p>\n<p>Who knows what Tom Cruise is like in real-life? Who cares? All I know is that his movies are awesome. They may not be up there with Citizen Kane in the usual all-time best movies list, but so what, those lists have nothing to do with the enjoyability quotient of films.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs a list of my top-ten Tom Cruise films:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Firm</li>\n<li>Jerry Maguire</li>\n<li>Cocktail</li>\n<li>Top Gun</li>\n<li>Risky Business</li>\n<li>Mission Impossible</li>\n<li>Collateral</li>\n<li>A Few Good Men</li>\n<li>Mission: Impossible 3</li>\n<li>Minority Report</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See, I haven't even included Rain Man in the top ten and yet Rain Man is a great film</p>\n<p>His films are enjoyable, memorable and quotable. There‚Äôs hardly a day goes by when I don‚Äôt say to Lauren ‚Äò<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002WZTOI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0002WZTOI\">Negative Ghost Rider, the pattern is full</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0002WZTOI\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" />‚Äô in response to any one of her ‚ÄòDaddy can I please‚Ä¶‚Äô.</p>\n<p>He‚Äôs not immune to the odd dud movie. Vanilla Sky was extremely misjudged, Days of Thunder gets called Top Gun on wheels but it‚Äôs no where near as good, and All the Right Moves, one of his early movies, is very forgettable. Mission Impossible 2 was an abomination. They should have never let John Woo anywhere near it.</p>\n<p>Eyes Wide Shut gets a lot of criticism but I don‚Äôt mind it. Despite the strange, drawn-out dialogue, I found the plot quite compelling, if not a little weird. I didn‚Äôt like Magnolia the first time I watched it but it has since grown on me.</p>\n<p>The Outsiders is a great adaptation of a modern classic novel, and I loved TAPS when I watched it as a teenager. War of the Worlds is good as is Born on the Fourth of July - a performance deserving of his Academy Award nomination.</p>\n<p>A few of his films are watchable but a bit ordinary: Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Knight and Day, Valkyrie, Lions for Lambs, The Last Samurai, and Interview with a Vampire I would put in this category.</p>\n<p>Tom Cruise was the best and perhaps only good thing about Tropic Thunder.</p>\n<p>I haven‚Äôt seen Rock of Ages yet but it looks good fun, and I‚Äôm really looking forward to Jack Reacher.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs still a few more that I haven‚Äôt mentioned but that just goes to show what a great back-catalogue he has.</p>\n<p>So leave off!</p>\n",

The company I work for is considering applying for us to offer <a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/pci_forensic_investigator.php\">PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI)</a> services, and in order to become eligible there needs to be a number of us suitably qualified. If I were to become a PFI it would sit nicely beside my current <a href=\"/blog/224/pci-qsa\">PCI QSA</a> designation, so as well as auditing organisations to ensure they adequately protect credit card information, I could also be called on to conduct a forensic investigation in the event they suffered a breach of cardholder data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sans.org/security-training/computer-forensic-investigations-windows-in-depth-1207-mid\">The course</a> was fairly intense but it mainly focused on Windows forensics.

The technical aspects were superb and the forensic toolkit that shipped with the course has already come in useful. The course is not just technical however, it also covers the procedural side of forensics and e-Discovery. This is necessary, but being a US-based course it was based on US federal legislation and procedures. I‚Äôll need to bone up on the related Australian legislation and evidentiary procedures to ensure I‚Äôm doing the right things to satisfy chain of custody and admissability of evidence for any investigations here.</p>\n",

So was the case with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UXUX4Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004UXUX4Q\">The Descendants</a>.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1376\">From the opening narration in which he explains that living in paradise doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that life is paradise, George Clooney is captivating in the role of Matt King, a descendant of one of Hawaii‚Äôs first white land-owning families.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1379\">Matt‚Äôs extended family, which is spread across the Hawaii islands, has a decision to make as to whether to sell a large plot of highly desirable beachfront virgin forest on Kauai to developers, who will inevitably open it up for tourist development.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1382\">Most of the family have already made their mind up. To them it‚Äôs a no-brainer - the sale will make them all rich. However, as the sole trustee of the land, Matt has the ultimate responsibility to make the final decision - a decision that forces him to consider the opposing views of his family and the islanders who want the land to remain unspoilt. This is all at the same time as facing a personal crisis.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1385\">At the beginning of the film we see that Matt‚Äôs wife is involved in a water skiing accident which puts her in a coma. This forces Matt to effectively become a single parent to his two daughters, one of whom is the teenager Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) who returns from boarding school with a bad attitude.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1388\">The bad attitude is borne out of resentment; resentment for her father who up until then has always put his business before his family, and resentment for her mother who, unbeknownst to Matt, has been having an affair with another man.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1391\">Rocked by his wife‚Äôs accident, Matt‚Äôs world comes crashing down once again when Alexandra blurts out the truth about his wife. This devastating, dramatic moment for the main character actually sets the stage for one of the films funniest scenes, as George Clooney, looking completely un-cool in high-waisted khaki shorts and Hawaiian shirt, slips on a pair of thongs (flip-flops) and runs down the mountain to challenge the friends of his wife who must have known about the affair. If you‚Äôve ever attempted to run in thongs you can imagine how ungainly this looks.</p><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0007TKOAA\" title=\"\" alt=\"\" /><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1395\">If I tell you that The Descendants is written and directed by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0668247/\">Alexander Payne</a>, who previously wrote and directed another favourite of mine - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0007TKOAA\">Sideways</a>, you may know that you‚Äôre not just getting a moving, family drama. A wonderful black humour ripples throughout this movie, at times blending tragedy and hilarity within the same scene.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1404\">The bulk of the story follows Matt moving around the Hawaii islands attempting to track down his wife‚Äôs lover, at the same time as trying to deal with his unruly daughter and her brain-dead friend Sid, who is the source for many of the laughs throughout the film. The carefully crafted script ensures that the business, family and emotional troubles are tied together expertly in the final scenes.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1407\">The movie is scored throughout with beautiful, soft, Hawaiian music - the kind of music you want to listen to whilst sat at a beach bar on a tropical paradise island watching the sun descend over the horizon.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1410\">After watching a lot of films lately which were, frankly, disappointing, it was a joy to sit down to something which gripped me from beginning to end. George Clooney fully deserves his Oscar nomination for this film.</p>\n",

This was genuinely a new idea expertly executed by a great director - Christopher Nolan.</p>\n<p>So when I saw the trailer for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWZW7E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004LWZW7E\">In Time</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004LWZW7E\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" />\n I was hoping that this would be the next in a new era of interesting films based on an original concept. </p>\n<p>It certainly has the potential from the synopsis. In Time is set in the future where people stop ageing at the age of 25 and are engineered to live only 1 more year. To continue living people have to purchase top-ups of time, just like topping up a mobile phone balance. There is no money as such - time is the currency. People work and receive their income in units of time, and everything is paid for with those units of time.</p>\n<p>This world of the future is much like today; the rich can top-up with decades at a time, essentially becoming immortal, while the poor have to beg, borrow or steal enough hours just to make it through the day. </p>\n<p>Justin Timberlake plays Will Salas, a man in the latter category who, through being in the wrong place at the wrong time, gets falsely accused of murder and is forced to go on the run with a hostage - Sylvia Weis, played by Amanda Seyfried.</p>\n<p>There's not much more you need to know. Unlike Inception, this isn't going to make you want to go back and watch it again to make sure you followed it all. </p>\n<p>In Time tries to tread a line between being a popcorn Sci-fi on one hand, and a social commentary on the inherent unfairness in capitalism on the other. It's somewhere between Robin Hood and Bonnie and Clyde.</p>\n<p>The message is a little muddled though. A number of times in the film Will Salas is questioned about the morality of stealing and his reply is 'Is it wrong to steal if it has already been stolen?', but there's no clarification on what he means. The wealth on show in the area known as New Greenwich seems to be mostly inherited wealth, so in what way has it been stolen?</p>\n<p>As is the custom for these movies, Will Salas does some serious ass kicking. At the beginning of the movie he's an ordinary factory worker, yet halfway through the movie he turns into James Bond, taking baddies out with comical ease. Unless I missed it there's no explanation of where he got his fighting and shooting skills.</p>\n<p>Also, some of the special effects were decidedly dodgy. In particular there's one where the car the 'goodies' are driving flips over. It reminded me of that scene in Die Another Day where the Drag Racing car falls over the side of the ice cliff. I was looking for the strings - very Thunderbirds-esque.</p>\n<p>If I were rating this film on quality I'd probably give it 2 stars but my ratings are simply based on how much I enjoyed the film. Despite all the flaws it is fairly entertaining, hence 3 stars. Just take my advice - turn off your brain at the start of the film!</p>\n",

I‚Äôm aware of his work and had an idea what to expect. I‚Äôve got <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KGBISE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003KGBISE\">Antichrist</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003KGBISE\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" /> queued up to watch but haven‚Äôt dared to sit through it yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006KH6CF4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006KH6CF4\">Melancholia</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B006KH6CF4\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" /> tells the story of two sisters and is in two parts. Part 1 focuses on Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her wedding day. To begin with she seems like any normal newly wed - deliriously happy and truly in love. It isn‚Äôt long, however, until we learn that something is not quote right with Justine. She suffers from depression, maybe she‚Äôs bi-polar, it isn‚Äôt spelt out. As the night progresses the demons inside her take hold and self-destruction begins.</p>\n<p>The second half focuses on her sister - Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and her anxiety caused by the impending event.</p>\n<p>I should mention at this point that the impending event is the potential end of the world. I‚Äôm not giving anything away here as the end of the world takes place in the first 5 minutes of the movie. A completely bizarre opening which features slow-motion images of scenes from throughout the film set to the haunting strings of Wagner, culminating in a planet, which we later learn is called Melancholia, approaching and colliding with Earth.</p>\n<p>I can‚Äôt say I particularly enjoyed this film. The first half was fairly interesting, albeit flawed. The second half was simply boring. How can the impending end of the world be so boring? The film seemed to just drag on and on and on.</p>\n<p>Melancholia is not a mainstream movie. It‚Äôs an art piece which was nominated for the Palm d‚ÄôOr at last year‚Äôs Cannes Film Festival. It has been nominated for a number of different awards and has received a lot of good reviews from film critics. </p>\n<p>When I read reviews of art pieces such as this it makes me wonder whether the 5 star rating is due to the critic generally thinking it is a great movie, or, because they want to be part of the pretentious intelligentsia club and don‚Äôt want people to think they don‚Äôt understand the underlying meanings of the film.</p>\n<p>I got that Melancholia is a film that explores mental illness. I could see that the anxiety that increased within Claire as Melancholia came ever closer to Earth was used as a metaphor for how depression works; the growing feeling of despair that builds up even though you know there‚Äôs no logical reason for it. I get all that and I‚Äôm sure that people who have suffered with depression will find Melancholia painfully familiar. That doesn‚Äôt make it a great film though.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not averse to arty independent films, and I don‚Äôt necessarily mind strange films, but even strange films should have their own internal logic. The actions of some of the characters in Melancholia just didn‚Äôt seem plausible. For example, the idea that Justin‚Äôs boss would set her a work task on her own wedding night, and her mother acting the way she does at her own daughters wedding reception, just didn't ring true. There are some callous people out there but does anyone seriously know anybody that would behave in that way?</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the film that grated was the camera work. Yet another film using the annoying ‚Äòshaky‚Äô hand-held camera technique. </p>\n<p>On the positive there is a good supporting cast, including Kiefer Sutherland, John Hurt and Stellan Skarsg√•rd. It‚Äôs hard to watch Kiefer Sutherland though and not think of Jack Bauer. When Justine‚Äôs mother pissed him off at the wedding reception I was half expecting him to do some arse kicking!</p>\n<p>Talking about Jack Bauer, a lot of the camera angles used in Melancholia seemed to be copied directly from the later seasons of 24, such as filming conversations as if observed from half-hidden behind a corner. Those type of techniques could work in horror or spy films but it‚Äôs really unnecessary for what‚Äôs basically a drama.</p>\n<p>Also on the positive side is the cinematography. The setting of the film is never mentioned and it‚Äôs made hard to discern by the mixed nationality of the characters - there‚Äôs no explanation why Justine has got an American accent, whereas her sister and parents are English. It looked to me like the film was shot in Scotland but I now know the exterior shots were largely shot around Tjol√∂holm Castle in Sweden, and it does look stunning.</p>\n<p>This is the second film of 2011 that I‚Äôve watched about another planet approaching Earth, the other being <a href=\"/blog/579/another-earth-2011\">Another Earth</a>, and in both films the other planet is used mainly as a plot device. Neither film is worth a second viewing.</p>\n",

We learn throughout the film how good he is and how well regarded he is by his peers. When he goes to the trade shows he doesn‚Äôt need to fall for the patter of the sales guys - he makes all his own equipment, perfectly tuned to his needs.</p>\n<p>Like many of the great films of the 70‚Äôs, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O7I6SE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003O7I6SE\">The Conversation</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003O7I6SE\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" /> requires a little patience. It‚Äôs a tad slow in the first half but it‚Äôs not for nothing.  The slow pace helps to give us a sense of who Harry Caul is.</p>\n<p>We learn that he‚Äôs a surveillance expert now working in New York after an assignment on the West Coast resulted in the death of three people. He likes to see himself as the ultimate professional and tells himself he‚Äôs not personally responsible - he was simply hired to do a job. Yet we can clearly see that he‚Äôs riddled with guilt, and determined not to get personally affected by any jobs in the future. </p>\n<p>He sees himself as the consummate professional. His job is to record the conversations, not to wonder why his clients want the conversations to be recorded in the first place. The less he knows the better - he can‚Äôt feel responsible if he has no clue about the potential consequences.</p>\n<p>He takes the same principles into this latest job. He‚Äôs paid to covertly record a conversation between two people in a public park, no easy job when you consider it‚Äôs lunch-time in Manhattan so the park is very busy and the subjects are constantly moving - suspicious that they may be being watched</p>\n<p>After successfully making the recordings he needs to deliver a finished product to his client. The initial raw recordings are not much use;  the conversation is distorted and comes in and out as the subjects are constantly moving. We see how Harry fine-tunes and mixes separate sources together, filtering out background interference so that the target conversation slowly but surely becomes audible.</p>\n<p>This is where Harry‚Äôs problems begin. The more he listens to the tapes in a repeated effort to capture the full conversation, the more he becomes absorbed by the substance of the conversation taking place. He can‚Äôt help but become concerned when he realises the two people being recorded appear to be in grave danger.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, like many security guys, Harry doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòeat his own dog food‚Äô. Later in the movie the tapes of the recordings are stolen because he fails to secure his workplace properly. He also allows himself to be tricked by a competitor when his private conversation is recorded using a ball-point pen - a gift from the competitor who is so desperate to go into business with him. These lapses from an otherwise diligent professional ends up putting himself in as much danger as he believes the subjects of his recordings are.</p>\n<p>I loved the attention that <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O7I6SE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003O7I6SE\">The Conversation</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003O7I6SE\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" /> paid to Harry‚Äôs tradecraft. As a security professional myself it was wonderful to see that tools and methods that Harry uses. It‚Äôs also interesting to see how little has changed. The technology may have moved on but everything else seemed very familiar. For example the trade show that Harry attends seems just like any modern-day security conference, just without the Plasma screens; and with vendors trying to get the attendees on their mailing lists instead of email lists as they do today. </p>\n<p>You can‚Äôt watch The Conversation now and not think of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428115/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=6305428115\">Enemy of the State</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=6305428115\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" />\n, in which Gene Hackman plays a very similar role. I wonder if Gene Hackman chose the role in Enemy of the State because he loved playing Harry Caul, or the producers of Enemy of the State chose Gene Hackman because he was so great in The Conversation?</p>\n<p>The Conversation came out two years after the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal\">Watergate scandal</a> and the influence is clear to see; exploring the themes of paranoia, invasion of privacy and its consequences. The Conversation is not an action-paced thriller like Enemy of the State, it‚Äôs more mysterious and cerebral.</p>\n<p>As the pieces come together, The Conversation culminates with a shocking twist - a twist which I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt see coming. Even after the film had finished it took a couple of hours for me to fully appreciate all the intricacies of the plot.</p>\n",

Thirty minutes in and I was already forcing myself to stay awake.</p>\n<p>When there were actual human beings on screen having a conversation, it wasn‚Äôt too bad, but as soon as it switched again to yet another action scene it quickly lost me.</p>\n<p>The problem with the big spectacle action set pieces is that they‚Äôre 90% CG. Yes, CG has come a long way in the last few years but it‚Äôs still not anywhere near realistic. Go back and look at a spectacular action scene shot before CG, such as the train crash near the beginning of The Fugitive. A lot of money way spent on that scene and it really is breathtaking and realistic - because it uses real, tangible objects. CG just doesn‚Äôt have the depth. It‚Äôs like watching a computer game.</p>\n<p>Michael Bay publicly admitted that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was below even his own poor par (his exact words were \"When I look back at it, that was crap‚Äù).

				"content_text": "<p>2010 was such a great year. I was lucky enough to travel the world to many places I‚Äôve never visited before, and the year culminated in our fantastic wedding; a perfect day made even better by the visit of family and friends we haven‚Äôt seen since we emigrated.\nSo maybe it shouldn‚Äôt be such a surprise that to provide balance, 2011 would turn out to be shite!</p>\n<p>The other day I was trying to think of something I‚Äôve achieved during 2011, some objective completed for which I can be proud. I struggled to come up with anything. In retrospect I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt make any new year‚Äôs resolutions last year as they would be a big, fat failure.</p>\n<p>At least I can be proud of Lauren. She turned 10 this year and I think we‚Äôve done a fine job of raising her even if I do say so myself. There‚Äôs always the danger with a single child that she‚Äôll be a selfish, spoilt little brat. I may be biased or blinkered (what parent isn‚Äôt?), but I certainly don‚Äôt see any sign of that in Lauren.</p>\n<p>The main setbacks for me personally this year have been my health. I somehow managed to get kidney stones and gallstones at the same time, which took an age to properly diagnose and resulted in multiple trips to A&amp;E, and eventually led to the removal of my gall bladder. When your health goes south everything else tends to take a back-burner. So much of this year was a write-off.</p>\n<p>At least 2011 was a great year to be a spectator. For a news junkie like me, 2011 will go down in history as a remarkable year, what with the Arab Spring; earthquake in Japan and Fukishima disaster; deaths of Osama Bin Laden, Steve Jobs, and Kim Jong-Il; Brisbane floods; UK riots; Wikileaks cables; phone-hacking scandal and the closure of the News of the World, etc.</p>\n<p>On the business front, all the stats are looking great for IPChitChat, certainly compared to 2010 and taking into account everyone was bracing for a global economic meltdown. I can‚Äôt take much credit for this. Michael, my business partner in the UK, has done a stellar job improving revenue and profit, and I‚Äôm hoping I can do more to contribute in 2012. We had a couple of other web projects that I was going to launch in 2011 which didn‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôm planning to get at least one of these off the ground early this year.</p>\n<p>Professionally, I‚Äôm still enjoying the day job and I‚Äôm hoping I can pick up some interesting work in 2012. There‚Äôs certainly no signs of IT Security work taking a slump!</p>\n<p>At least the year ended with a nice relaxing Christmas. I still can't get used to seeing fake snow on the front lawns of gardens in the middle of summer but I'm slowly getting more adjusted to the Aussie xmas. This christmas day was spent like many others since we arrived in Brisbane - nice long christmas lunch interspersed with dips in the pool. It may not be traditional but sitting in the pool with a glass of wine isn't a bad way to spend christmas day! </p>\n<p>Oh well, onwards and upwards. I have high hopes for 2012. The flights are booked for our first trip back to the UK since emigrating in 2007, in what could turn out to be an epic month. Our draft itinerary already includes Singapore, London, Venice, Paris and Hong Kong. The problem is, the amount of time we're likely to spend in Doncaster and Worksop seems to grow less and less as we discover more places we want to visit around Europe (can you blame us?).</p>\n",

I may be being pessimistic about our fellow mankind, but I‚Äôd expect society to start to break down much earlier than it does in Contagion. </p>\n<p>There‚Äôs far too many self-centred people in this world. Gone are the days when people would pull together as a community like during the blitz in the East End of London. It seems like today it would only take a shortage of Plasma TV‚Äôs for cities to resemble Beirut circa 1978.</p>\n<p>Look what happens each Black Friday in the US, or when there‚Äôs the rumours of fuel shortages in the UK, or simply during Christmas shopping. Imagine then, what it would be like if there were shortages of something really important, such as food or medical supplies. It would be every man for himself. Furthermore, imagine what it would be like in the US, with 35% of households possessing a gun. It would be like scenes from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082340/\">Escape from New York</a>.</p>\n<p>All of this is portrayed in Contagion but it felt somewhat flat. It‚Äôs certainly not a thriller. Contagion is a slow, meticulous drama which focuses on the technicalities faced by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the US and the World Health Organisation (WHO). At times it felt more like a documentary than an exciting edge-of-the-seat thriller about the fight to save mankind.</p>\n<p>Contagion is good enough as 106 mins of though-provoking entertainment, but it could have been so much better. In fact, I reckon <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114069/\">Outbreak</a> is a better movie.</p>\n",

Sometimes I'm attuned to these things, not this time.</p>\n<p>Robert Pattinson plays Tyler Hawkins, a young New Yorker who is grieving for the loss of his brother. </p>\n<p>Tyler doesn‚Äôt handle the grief very well. He‚Äôs rebellious. He drinks and smokes too much and generally has a bad attitude. He‚Äôs clearly got anger issues; the main cause of that anger being his father. He doesn‚Äôt explicitly say it, but we can see that he holds his father responsible for the death of his brother.</p>\n<p>Through a twist of fate he meets Ally (Emilie de Ravin). And it is a twist of fate. In a city of 8 million people you have to wonder at the odds that they would meet in the way they do.</p>\n<p>Ally has also been affected by tragedy, and their shared experience and grief helps bring them together.</p>\n<p>At this point you may think this is just another soppy love story. In a way it is, but I found this movie deeply affecting. The characters are engaging. The blossoming relationship between Tyler and Ally is well handled. </p>\n<p>The relationship between Tyler and his father, played by Pierce Brosnan, is probably the most interesting aspect of the film. Pierce Brosnan puts in a great performance, in spite of the slightly dodgy caricature New Jersey accent.</p>\n<p>The plot is like a Shakespearean tragedy. Maybe a bit overdone. After the coincidences that led to Tyler and Ally meeting, we are expected to suspend disbelief again for another set of coincidences that leads to the climactic finale. In an inferior film this would be a problem. In the case of Remember Me I wasn‚Äôt bothered by it at all. It was a fitting ending to a powerful and thought-provoking film.</p>\n",

Not so. Instead, this film tries to make us feel sorry for the rich guy - Bobby Walker - a sales executive who loses his extremely cushy job, with a great salary and benefits, and, shock-horror, even loses his Porsche.</p>\n<p>The definition of poverty is relative. To much of the world, poverty may mean living on $1 a day, not having running water or proper sanitisation. To us in the western world the benchmark for poverty is entirely different. As was reported during the UK riots this year, the benchmark for poverty in the UK is not having a second car or Sky +. Surely that can‚Äôt be true?</p>\n<p>The story is interesting enough and there‚Äôs a great cast, including Ben Affleck (playing Bobby Walker) and Tommy Lee Jones (playing Gene McLary), but if the Director‚Äôs aim was for us to empathise with Bobby Walker then he has surely failed.</p>\n<p>There is something extremely unsettling about this film. I felt uncomfortable watching it. Oh look, rich people have problems too. Look at this poor guy, he can no longer afford his country club fees!</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre expecting to see the main character go through a lazarus moment where he comes back from the pits of despair and is transformed by the experience, think again.</p>\n<p>Even at the end, when he finds work in a job where his salary is only half what it was before, there‚Äôs no real evidence that he has reformed his thinking in any way. The film ends before we can find out if he repeats the same capitalist excesses. For all we know, he may be just as much of an arrogant, wasteful arsehole as he was before.</p>\n<p>By the way, do you think Ben Affleck‚Äôs agent has been instructed to only look at scripts that are set in Boston?</p>\n",

Rhoda Williams is a high school student who has just been accepted to MIT. She has a promising future but her world falls apart one night when, after a night of drinking, she drives and crashes into the Burroughs family, killing the wife and son, and leaving the husband in a coma. </p>\n<p>The second thread, and the event that causes her to lose concentration that night ultimately resulting in the tragic event, is the news on the radio that scientists have discovered a planet moving towards Earth which seems to be an exact replica of our own planet. This planet is quickly dubbed Earth 2.</p>\n<p>The main character, Rhoda Williams, is played by Brit Marling, who also co-wrote the film‚Äôs script with first-time director Mike Cahill.</p>\n<p>The husband and father that Rhoda has left in a coma, John Burroughs (William Mapother), is a successful composer and professor. </p>\n<p>Both Rhoda‚Äôs and John‚Äôs lives are devastated by the crash, but four years later, events transpire to bring them together, in what becomes the focus of the film.</p>\n<p>I love the ideas presented in this film. The plot focuses on the human relationships and the tragedy. The sci-fi element is a back-drop, which becomes more intertwined towards the end. Ultimately, however, it is the lack of focus on the world-changing event that lets Another Earth down. It‚Äôs hard to care about the characters and relationships when in the background they‚Äôre playing news footage of what could potentially be mankind‚Äôs first contact with other lifeforms; the big idea is far more interesting and engaging than the human tragedy.</p>\n<p>Another Earth has a tremendously slow pace. It plods along as if it‚Äôs purposefully trying to tell you it‚Äôs a film that you must take seriously. I don‚Äôt mind slow-paced, independent films built around tragedy. One of my favourites of this type is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385017/\">In My Father‚Äôs Den</a> starring Matthew Macfadyen, but Another Earth is not even in the same league as In My Father‚Äôs Den.</p>\n<p>The idea of another planet Earth is compelling and brings up many interesting questions. Also, the background scenes of Earth 2 in the night sky along with the moon look really good, but to go along with this film you need to suspend logic and ignore the laws of physics. There are some serious holes in the science. For a start, forget all you know about gravity.</p>\n<p>In general, it‚Äôs worth a watch but the concept is far better than the delivery.</p>\n",

We first learn that Barney has a suspect past when he is confronted by a Detective in a bar - a Detective who is clearly frustrated that Barney is still a free man in spite of his attempts to get him convicted for murder. This is the trigger for a flashback to the story that leads Barney to that point - beginning just before his first marriage; a marriage featuring a wedding ceremony that probably qualifies as the most un-romantic in history.</p>\n<p>The detective is played by the superb <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004692/\">Mark Addy</a> - the Yorkshireman who has managed to carve for himself a career in Hollywood on the back of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119164/\">The Full Monty</a>.</p>\n<p>Barney is played with great effect by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0316079/\">Paul Giamatti</a>, an actor who divides opinion in the Haines household. I think Paul Giamatti is outstanding whereas Rachelle finds him annoying. But maybe that‚Äôs because I, unlike Rachelle, saw and loved <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/\">Sideways</a> and the incredible HBO series - <a href=\"http://www.tv.com/john-adams/show/75065/summary.html\">John Adams</a>. It was great performances in these that have led to him, with justification, getting lead parts where previously he would only get supporting ones.</p>\n<p>Barney is likeable as a character, yet it feels wrong to like him. After all, this is someone who leaves his own wedding reception to pursue a woman he‚Äôs just met at said wedding reception. What is it that gets three women to agree to marry him? Maybe it‚Äôs the same charm that makes you like him despite his considerable flaws. This is a man who seems to have no filter for his words or actions; he acts impulsively, seemingly without thought of the consequences to those close to him.</p>\n<p>Barney‚Äôs third wife, Miriam, is played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683253/\">Rosamund Pike</a> - the posh British ‚Äòtotty‚Äô who most notably, for Bond fans such as myself, played Miranda Frost in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460/\">Die Another Day</a>.¬† She also had key roles in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1174732/\">An Education</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371155/\">Made in Dagenham</a>, both remarkable movies fully deserving of the positive critical reviews they received.</p>\n<p>Miriam is mesmerising, Far too good for Barney.¬† When she finally succumbs to his charm you‚Äôre left wondering whether she actually likes him or has just given in to his persistence. The question is quickly put to rest as you see their life together progress in the final stages of the film. You‚Äôre also left wondering why she puts up with him. Barney has supposedly found the love of his life yet this doesn‚Äôt manage to halt his course of self-destruction.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs some great supporting characters too. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000163/\">Dustin Hoffman</a> can be credited with a lot of the movie‚Äôs laughs. He plays Barney‚Äôs father - a loveable rogue and serial philanderer, who leaves no doubt as to the lineage of Barney.</p>\n<p>To complete the package, Barney‚Äôs Version has a great soundtrack, featuring Jazz classics from the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Leonard Cohen, as well as 70‚Äôs music befitting the first half of the film.</p>\n<p>I loved Barney‚Äôs Version. The story is funny, moving at times, and thoroughly engaging. What‚Äôs more, there‚Äôs a ring of truth to the scenes; where even the most innocuous moment seems recognisable. Anyone who has had an argument, lied, or been lied to, will recognise the body language and eye movement; the sub-conscious human traits that mark the performance of great actors.</p>\n",

When Barbara accidentally discovers that Sheba is having an affair with one of the students, she decides to take advantage of Sheba's situation to get close to her.</p>\n<p>As the plot unfolded I wasn't quite sure where it was going. It seemed to me that there was more to Barbara's motives than appeared. Was it just a case of a lonely old Lesbian wanting to take advantage of the situation to get some action, or could it be something else?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, what started as a highly intriguing story tapered off towards the end leaving me feeling that it should have been so much more. At least the superb writing and acting by the two former Queens and Bill Nighy compensated slightly for the underwhelming plot.</p>\n<p>I found the most engaging aspect of the film to be Barbara Covett‚Äôs first-person narration. It reminded me a lot of the narration by Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) in American Psycho. Not to say that Barbara is a serial killer.</p>\n<p>In some movies narration is essentially a cop-out by the Director who doesn‚Äôt know how to properly tell the story. In Notes on A Scandal the narration is crucial. It immediately allows us access to Barbara‚Äôs bitter, twisted personality; the mask of a lonely old spinster hiding her contempt for ‚Äòmodern‚Äô families, the education system, and the superficiality of today‚Äôs Britain.</p>\n<p>The narration also gives us some of the best lines. Barbara is clearly a frustrated writer. When she‚Äôs not writing in her diary her thoughts are expressed to us as if she‚Äôs writing fine literature. An example of this is when she‚Äôs sitting on the stairs listening to the argument between Sheba and her husband - ‚ÄúI sat in the gods while the aria unfolded before me‚Äù. Sheba sums this up towards the end of the film with a put-down to Barbara ‚Äúyou think you're fucking Virginia Woolf!‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Another problem for me was the relationship between Sheba and the 15 year-old student. It seems slightly implausible, as does her marriage to the older husband. But of course, these things happen. Women marry older men, even older men that aren't rich. Affairs between teachers and schoolboys do occur. Although I'm sure not as often as your average 15 year old schoolboys might purport.</p>\n<p>In summary, an interesting enough story, above average writing and acting, but let down by an unfulfilling finale.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204127\">I‚Äôve decided to start writing some short movie reviews on here. I‚Äôve got quite a large DVD collection, most of of which I‚Äôve now copied on to my Apple TV set-up. In my geekness, I‚Äôve got movies stored on a couple of external hard disks connected to my wireless router so that I can stream them wirelessly to any of the Apple TVs. We‚Äôve somehow ended up with 3 in our house. Surely that‚Äôs more than is healthy for any small family?\nMy ratings will be based on the 5 stars system. Half stars are allowed so it‚Äôs effectively a score out of ten.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204130\">Unlike ‚Äòproper‚Äô critical reviews from bona-fide film critics, my ratings aren‚Äôt based on the quality of the film as judged by the usual standards. I simply rate films based on how much I enjoyed them or otherwise appreciated them. For instance, there‚Äôs certain comedies that may get a slating by the film critics and have a low rating on IMDB, but if they make me laugh I‚Äôm going to give them a higher rating, simple as. </p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204133\">There‚Äôs quite a few oscar winners and so-called ‚Äòclassics‚Äô that I‚Äôve seen which have bored me to tears. When that‚Äôs the case it gets a low rating. I don‚Äôt care if it was considered ground-breaking in its time, with beautiful cinematography and a narrative which captures the zeitgeist of the moment.  If I yawned, it gets a low rating. An example which I saw for the first time recently is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041959\">The Third Man (1949)</a>. There‚Äôs my invitation to join the British Film Institute out of the window!</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204139\">I‚Äôll very rarely review the latest releases as I generally wait until they‚Äôre out on DVD/Blueray. In fact, I‚Äôve now boycotted the cinema after my experience during the last 2 visits. I took the family to see both Super 8 and the final Harry Potter, and on both occasions the experience was ruined by inconsiderate twats; munching, coughing, talking, slurping and causing light pollution from their mobile phones for the entire length of the film. They obviously have no appreciation for the Wittertainment Code of Conduct‚Ä¶</p>\n\n\n \n   [youtube [www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A-KV_xkrnc&w=640&h=390])\n \n\n<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204145\">I‚Äôve currently got a patent lawyer looking into whether or not anyone else has patented my invention of wireless audio streaming in cinemas to surround-sound headphones that they can hand out like they do 3-D glasses. Not really. You can have that idea for free.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204148\">Talking about 3-D. I‚Äôm certainly over that gimmick. I actually like to see a sharp, bright picture, not the slightly blurred, dim experience you get through 3-D glasses, for which you have to pay a premium through the ticket price.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204151\">If I do visit the cinema again it will be to see a film nobody else wants to see. On a Sunday morning. Alternatively, it will be during the Summer to catch one of the Movies in the Park.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204154\">Then again, open-air cinema isn‚Äôt really the place to appreciate a film first time round.  Not when you‚Äôre surrounded by heavy-petting teenagers and the dulcet tones of the generator for a burger van whirring away in the background.</p>\n",

Ms. Baskerville complained to the PCC that she had a \"reasonable expectation\" that the tweets would only be accessible to her followers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But the PCC said her potential audience is much wider than that, ‚Äúnot least because any message could easily be retweeted to a wider audience,‚Äù the organization ruled. She‚Äôd also neglected to restrict public access to her tweets and apparently forgot that Tweets in feed that is not invitation-only show up in a public timeline anyone can browse or search.\n<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/02/uk-tweets-are-public-info/\">http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/02/uk-tweets-are-public-info/</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>And in other news, the PCC ruled that the Editor's Code of Practice was not breached when one newspaper stated that the Pope is catholic and Bears do indeed shit in the woods.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>It has been devastating watching the catastrophe unfold in the city that I've grown to love. I've said before that this is the first place where I've truly felt settled. It's the city we chose to live in when deciding to emigrate, and we've never once regretted it.\nMany parts of Brisbane are now a disaster zone, including some of my favourite places. Of course buildings and places can be re-built; there's nothing that can be done to replace the lives that have been lost. </p>\n<p>The heart and soul of Brisbane has been damaged and it's going to be a long time before things are back to normal.</p>\n<p>When we've had visitors arrive from the UK, to give them a good taste of what's best about Brisbane we always used to drive to Bulimba or Hawthorne and take the CityCat catamaran service down the river, around the Central Business District (CBD), and get off at South Bank. The South Bank Parklands being my favourite place in the city. </p>\n<p>The CityCat service has largely been destroyed. Not the catamarans as such, but the majority of the terminals. Similarly, South Bank Parklands have been inundated by the floods.</p>\n<div style=\"float:left;\"><img src=\"http://asset.ninemsn.com.au/img/000/000/139/702/NataliePeluso.jpg\" alt=\"Riverside and Eagle St Pier, Brisbane\" /></div>\n<div style=\"float:left;margin-left:10px;\"><img src=\"http://asset.ninemsn.com.au/img/000/000/139/901/1301_cbd9_sl.jpg\" alt=\"Brisbane flooding\" /></div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" />\nImages courtesy of <a href=\"http://news.ninemsn.com.au/slideshowajax/140024/queensland-devastated-by-floods.slideshow\">Channel 9</a></p>\n<p>It looks like it's going to take 2 years to re-build the areas that are affected. It's going to be a long clean-up process requiring lots of resources. More than 26,000 homes and 5000 businesses in 67 suburbs have been affected. More than 150 roads remain closed and many part of the city are still without power.</p>\n<p>We've been very lucky that we chose to move to the Redlands area. We did look at rental properties in Milton, Toowong and other inner-Brisbane suburbs which have been hit, but chose to move out here instead.</p>\n<p>At work (the day job) we're also looking at what we can do to help out in the community. Our engineers are already hard at work helping out our customers who have been impacted. Many customers had to invoke their Disaster Recovery plans, and we've got quite a few customers who need help re-building their networks to get their business up and running again. Besides that I know a lot of us want to help out with the clean-up effort in the local community. Our office is near Fortitude Valley which has been impacted by the flood, but we're situated on a hill so the office is unaffected. We also haven't been hit by the power cuts.</p>\n<p>I appreciate how lucky we've been that's why I want to help out as much as possible. Our Premier, Anna Bligh, who has been doing a sterling job, says that they need two things: volunteers and money. This couldn't come at a worse time for us if they want money. However, while we're short on cash I have been able to find another way that I can donate. Virgin Blue allows you to cash in your velocity points for cash donations. I've got plenty of those so that's what I've done. The page to make donations from Velocity Points is <a href=\"https://shop.velocityrewards.com.au/Pages/SOR/Browse.aspx?CategoryCode=RELIEF\">here</a> (it's quite hard to find on their website). I've also signed up with Volunteering Queensland. The form for that is <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/formResponse?formkey=dEVtTDQyWUZldUhUUjR6ZFlPWTNWR2c6MQ&amp;ifq\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It's very easy to start a new year and think about personal plans (see my last post). Then something like this comes along and puts it all into perspective. </p>\n",

				"title": "Review of 2010 / Plans for 2011",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A few years ago on BBC2 in the UK there was a programme called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Gorman\">Dave Gorman's</a> Important Astrology Experiment. I don't know if you watched it but the concept behind the series was that Dave would follow exactly what was recommended for his star sign in a selection of horoscopes, and then see how that affected his happiness. For measuring happiness he used the triad of Love, Health and Wealth.\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/338fb4c105.jpg\" alt=\"happiness-triad.jpg\" align=\"left\" /></p>\n<p>It was a funny series, but the reason I mention it is that I've always thought that using the happiness triad is a really good tool for life planning. If you think about it, most new year's resolutions will fall into one of the three boxes.</p>\n<p>I thought I'd share a few of my plans for 2011 and also look back at how 2010 measured against my own happiness triad.</p>\n<h3>Review of 2010</h3>\n<p>I'll start with last year. For Love, that's got to be a big positive because me and Rach finally tied the knot. Lauren makes me happy every day. All is well in the Haines household on the Love front.</p>\n<p>As for Health, that's been a mixed bag. I had no real health problems last year, with the exception of a few warning signs that it was time to slow down. I managed to lose a few pounds before the wedding, and then proceeded with much fervour to put them straight back on again during the month I had off work for the wedding and honeymoon, and 3 weeks for xmas. </p>\n<p>The warning signs were mainly due to too much drinking. I don't drink a fraction of what I did when I was in the Navy. Maybe that's the problem? In the Navy drinking was pretty much mandatory so my tolerance to it was much greater than it is today. In 2010, I didn't drink that often, but when I did it tended to be binge drinking. I had some really good nights out which involved drinking far more than is good for you, and on a few occasions i started to develop numbness on one side of my face after a drinking session, or during, which isn't a good thing. A kind of Bell's Palsy apparently, according to a nurse friend of ours.</p>\n<p>So on the health front it was a mixed bag. </p>\n<p>Finally there's Wealth. I look at wealth in two ways - financial wealth and wealth of knowledge.</p>\n<p>Financial wealth was going quiet well for most of the year. I've managed to maintain my 4-day a week job while steadily, but not greatly, growing the IPChitChat business. Although I still don't draw a salary from IPChitChat we did make a few payouts for ourselves during 2010 as a return on investment. This meant we were in a lucky position that Rachelle was able to give up her job and come and work from home for the business.</p>\n<p>All was going well with the finances up until the wedding. As much as you plan and budget, it always ends up costing more than you originally planned. And so it proved. Even though it was a relatively cheap wedding by comparison to the standard these days, we've still left ourselves with quite a bit of debt which I'll probably be paying off for the next 2 years! This means that coming into January Rach has started looking for a part-time job again just to help us through this sticky patch. It's funny how there seems to be an inverse relationship between love and wealth when it comes to getting married!</p>\n<p>In terms of wealth of knowledge, I feel that this is where I made the most gain in 2010. I was very lucky to travel quite a bit during 2010 and travel does indeed broaden the mind, even if I did spend most of it in bars! Similarly, I maintain an interest in lots of different subjects and read extensively. I don't know about you but I find as get older my thirst for knowledge increases exponentially. Importantly I learnt an enormous amount that will contribute to growing my business.</p>\n<p>On the business side of things I may look back at 2010 as a year of procrastination. There was no real major achievement but like I said, I did learn a lot. It's amazing how much you learn by doing the wrong things. I spent far too much time during 2010 just trying to get things to work, rather than concentrating on the big picture. I don't know how many hours I lost messing about with technical things that really should be left to someone who knows what they're doing. I've learnt that lesson. At the same time, those hours spent learning the technical side of business will help me in the future. I'll explain more when I discuss plans for 2011 below.</p>\n<p>So all in all not a bad year. Am I happier at the beginning of 2011 then I was in January 2010? I'd say yes, I am.</p>\n<h3>Plans for 2011</h3>\n<p>If we look at the Love side of the happiness triad, well I'm married now so I suppose it's just downhill from here! Just kidding. The emphasis for 2011 needs to be on life-balance. It's very easy to just get obsessed with work and forget that there's other people in my life. Even though I have a job and a separate business, I need to be conscious of the fact that i need to put some time aside as family time.  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, as the saying goes.</p>\n<p>Health, now that's a continuing battle. I know I've probably said this the last 10 years in a row, but this is the year when I get really fit and healthy. Honest. </p>\n<p>Wealth. I spent most of 2010 having my finances under control. My credit card balances were 0 because i paid the balance off in full each month. That was until the wedding. 2011 is going to be a frugal year. I've already made a concerted effort to reduce expenses. The next goal is to increase income, and the way I'm going to do that is through the business.</p>\n<p>I've now launched netcloudsecurity.com which will hopefully contribute something, but that's more out of a response to events. The problem with providing services, of any kind, is that the amount of $ output you get from it is entirely dependant upon the number of hours you put into it. The ultimate goal is surely to create passive income, where you create something that continues to generate revenue without further work from yourself.</p>\n<p>In the next few weeks I'll be launching another website, which will be my main focus of attention for the 2011. This website draws on my experience as a <a href=\"/blog/224/pci-qsa\">PCI QSA</a> and will hopefully be something that will help many businesses and individuals.</p>\n<p>They key business lesson that I've learnt from 2010 that I will apply to this year is that I definitely need to focus on the core activities that generate revenue. As I've said, far too much time was spent in 2010 troubleshooting technical problems and learning new technical skills. For example, I spent many a hour last year building my new PCI site using the Drupal Content Management System (CMS). <a href=\"http://www.drupal.org\">Drupal</a> is a fantastic CRM and in the right hands, can do everything you want it to. To save a bit of money and due to budgetary constraints, I decided to build the entire site myself. Whilst I got the majority of it built I spent hours if not days messing about trying to get some of the basics working, such as displaying my content correctly in RSS feeds.</p>\n<p>Last week I finally gave up on Drupal and the new website will be shortly launching in <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">Wordpress</a>. The Wordpress CRM is great for getting sites up and running very quickly. It perhaps doesn't offer all of the features that Drupal does but who cares, it's content that's important. I realise that now.</p>\n<p>For IPChitChat we had some great success with outsourcing, and we're now at the point where if we want anything doing technically with the website we'll simply outsource it. We've finally found some developers on <a href=\"http://www.elance.com/\">Elance.com</a> that we're really happy with and trust.  The developers we chose are a company in Vietnam. We placed a number of projects on Elance with them last year and because they're a) extremely affordable, b) professional, and c) quick to respond, we'll be using them for the majority of our technical work in 2011.</p>\n<p>You may think that you are saving money by doing it yourself but you're really not. I now follow my own advice that I've spouted many times before - you need to put a price on your time. If it takes you 2 weeks to do a job that an external developer can do in 2 days, is it really saving money to do it yourself?</p>\n<p>As an example, we had 3 jobs that we asked our developers to do last week. They did the entire work in 2 days for a total cost of $175. It would have taken me a week at least. A week of my time is worth far more than $175.</p>\n<p>I said previously that all the lost time in 2010 doing technical work was not entirely mis-spent. This is because having a certain level of knowledge really helps when you outsource work to others. For instance, If I decide to build any new sites in Drupal and outsource the work, I'm confident that I'll be able to draw up detailed specifications for the work, and be able to properly vet what gets delivered. There's also lots of small technical jobs that I'll be able to do quickly myself without having to outsource it.</p>\n<p>In summary, for 2011, the goal is to maintain the Love score, but improve on Health and Wealth.</p>\n",

				"title": "My Favourite Films of 2010",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>As is customary this time of year, here's a list of some of my favourites films from 2010. There's no doubt going to be other great films that came out in 2010 which aren't listed here simply because I haven't seen them yet, but these are the ones I have seen and enjoyed the most:</p>\n<h2>1. The Social Network</h2>\n<div id=\"blockleft\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bf85310a3f.jpg\" alt=\"The Social Network (HD).jpg\" align=\"left\" /></div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">My favourite film of the year was easily <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/\">The Social Network</a> - the movie about the founding of Facebook. The beauty of this film is that you don't need to be a Facebook user or even have ever heard of Facebook to enjoy it. The screenplay is written by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815070/\">Aaron Sorkin</a> who wrote <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/\">The West Wing</a> - my all-time favourite TV series, so I was very much looking forward to some fast-paced intelligent, witty dialogue. He didn't disappoint. Right from the opening scene where we are introduced to the brilliant, yet flawed genius that is Mark Zuckerberg, we were treated to some trademark Aaron Sorkin writing.</p>\n<p>Of course, the film isn't exactly accurate. There are many plot points which are contrary to the evidence provided by articles from the time and comments made by the protagonists themselves, yet this doesn't detract from the substance of the film. Like all good semi-biographical films, history is dramatised to make it more interesting. In an <a href=\"http://nymag.com/movies/features/68319/\">interview with the New York Magazine</a>, Aaron Sorkin freely admits that plot details are fabricated. </p>\n<p>You come away from watching The Social Networking thinking that yes, Mark Zuckerberg is a genius, but he's also a bit of a dick. To what extent that is true will only be known by those who know him. But it serves the plot well - focusing on the irony of the world's largest social network being created by someone so lacking in social skills.\n</p></div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<h2>2. Inception</h2>\n<div id=\"blockleft\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a71c9c61ca.jpg\" alt=\"Inception (HD).jpg\" align=\"left\" />\n</div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">\nOk, I admit that like most other people I got a bit lost trying to follow the plot of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/\">Inception</a>. Trying to keep track of whose dream the characters were in, or even dream within a dream, was a major task. I've watched this twice now and even on the second viewing I had to stop the film briefly and refer to the IMDB synopsis so I could figure out what was happening.</p>\n<p>A film that makes you work in this way might put off some people, but it shouldn't. Even if you don't understand what's going on you can still sit back and enjoy what is a remarkable, truly original cinematic experience. Saying that, I actually think I enjoyed it more the second time round watching it on my TV at home than I did in the cinema. The reason for this is that the music was just too damn loud in the cinema. The score for this film is very heavily lathered on from beginning to end, much like it is in The Dark Knight, also directed by Christopher Nolan. Being able to turn the volume down slightly at home on the second viewing made for a much more enjoyable experience.\n</p></div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<h2>3. City Island</H2></p>\n<div id=\"blockleft\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/134a64928e.jpg\" alt=\"City Island (HD).jpg\" align=\"left\" />\n</div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">\nThis is listed as a 2009 release on IMDB but it was a 2010 release for us in Australia. Maybe if movies got released around the world at the same time we might not be so inclined to download them free from torrent sites! It's absolutely rideculous that sometimes films aren't released until a full year after the date of release in the US.  Anyway...</p>\n<p>City Island is very much in the vein of American Beauty, about a dysfunctional family living on City Island - a small island in the New York City borough of the Bronx. This dark comedy starring Andy Garcia is a little gem. I'd never heard of the film before I came across it and had no idea of the plot before watching it. It's really funny and surprising.  Definitely worth a watch.\n</p></div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<h2>4. The Special Relationship</h2>\n<div id=\"blockleft\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/161fcff0fc.jpg\" alt=\"The_Special_Relationship_poster.jpg\" align=\"left\" />\n</div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1117646/\">The Special Relationship</a> is another one where some facts were glossed over and some events were invented for dramatic effect, as with Peter Morgan's other films about Tony Blair: The Deal and The Queen. I watched this shortly after reading Tony Blair's autobiography so it was interesting watching some of the events that TB described in his book play out on screen. I've never been the biggest TB fan and after watching this and reading his book it's very easy to appreciate his political skills and successes, but there's no doubt he's egotistical and likes to tell a few porkies now and then if he thinks the end justifies the means.\n</div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<h2>5. The Ghost Writer</h2>\n<div id=\"blockleft\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/914ab6d162.jpg\" alt=\"The Ghost Writer.jpg\" align=\"left\" />\n</div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">\nYou could say <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139328/\">The Ghost Writer</a> is another film about Tony Blair. Robert Harris wrote the screenplay for this film based on his book - The Ghost, and it shows as it pretty much follows the book word for word. Which is a good thing, because the book was very enjoyable.  Even so, it's not often that you can say the film was better than the book, but in this case I think it may well be.\n</div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" />\n<H2>Honourable Mentions</h2>\n<p>A few other films that I enjoyed this year include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289406/\">Harry Brown</a>. I'm a sucker for a good revenge thriller. Watching a decrepit (Michael Caine) kick the ass of a few hoodies in London makes for 2 very entertaining hours!</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1282140/\">Easy A</a>. Not normally the type of film I'd bother with but after reading some good reviews I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did. Emma Stone in this reminded me very much of Carey Mulligan's performance in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1174732/\">An Education</a> - one of my favourite films from 2009. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1341167/\">Four Lions</a>. A comedy about suicide bombers. That's the way to tackle religious extremists - laugh at their incompetence! Lots of laughs and it was good to see Sheffield and Meadowhall for a bit of nostalgia.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/\">Shutter Island</a>. Leonardo Di Caprio makes some really good choices when it comes to scripts. Here he again teams up with Martin Scorsese for another film which makes you work a little to understand what's going on. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815236/\">She's Out Of My League</a>. I watched this on the plane over to LA. This year hasn't been that great for comedies but this was one of the better ones.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375670/\">Grown Ups</a>. This received a lot of bad reviews but I actually enjoyed it. It certainly passed the laugh test for me. You can tell that it was written by Adam Sandler though. Very indulgent of him to cast his character as the funny guy who's also the hero.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440728/\">The American</a>. Not sure if this belongs here because to tell you the truth I found it a bit boring. On purpose this film is very slow and minimalistic. However George Clooney is always good value and in this he plays a character very similar to that he played in Michael Clayton, which I enjoyed immensely. It was watchable but I'm not in a hurry to watch it again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><H2>I'll Never Get Those Two Hours Back Again</h2>\n<p>Here's a list of some films from 2010 which I assign to the 'what a load of shit' category.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179034/\">From Paris with Love</a>. Far too much style over substance. A disappointing action flick. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1385867/\">Cop Out</a>. I don't think I laughed once. Really lame</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185416/\">When in Rome</a>. Every now and again I have to do the husbandly duty and sit through a chick flick with Rachelle. Some I don't mind and are actually quite good, such as It's Complicated and Julie &amp; Julia. When in Rome however is absolutely dire.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0955308/\">Robin Hood</a>. There's not many Ridley Scott or Russell Crowe films that I don't like. Frankly though, this new incarnation of Robin Hood was just too boring. It took me two sittings to get through it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429493/\">The A Team</a>. Pure sacrilege to make a crap job of a movie out of my childhood Saturday night viewing. Ridiculous and very forgettable</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/\">The Expendables</a>. The concept for this film was much better than the execution. What is it with Sylvester Stallone these days that he likes to revel in gore. Much like John Rambo, the violence was way over the top, even for an action film.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027718/\">Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</a>. The original Wall Street is one of my favourite films. This on the other hand is a snore fest. How very disappointing.</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I feel sorry for the ship's company of HMS Illustrious. They're shortly going to be feeling very embarrassed to be serving on an aircraft carrier that doesn't have any, err, aircraft.\nI remember my time fondly on HMS Invincible, the now decommissioned sister ship to HMS Illustrious, but I also remember feeling a slight inferiority complex whenever we were on NATO operations with the US Navy or even with the French carrier Charles de Gaulle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/105907569\" title=\"View 'HMS Invincible - Bahamas 1997' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/51/105907569_b5177e6a59_m.jpg\" alt=\"HMS Invincible - Bahamas 1997\" style=\"float:left;margin:10px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></p>\n<p>The US Navy didn't even consider our carriers proper Aircraft Carriers. The Invincible-class Aircraft Carriers being a similar size to the carriers that the US Marines use, but call Amphibious Assault Ships.</p>\n<p>The new Queen Elizabeth class Aircraft Carriers will be three times larger and much more capable, and will no doubt be the pride of the Royal Navy. But in the meantime, with the announcement of the immediate scrapping of the Harrier fleet there will be no Carrier-based jets up until the new ships arrive in 2020, if indeed they arrive on time (which would be a surprise given the history of defence procurement).</p>\n<p>I understand that 'difficult decisions have to be made' as David Cameron keeps saying, but it seems a major risk to me. If another Falklands type scenario popped up in 2018 I really don't see how the UK would be able to mount a successful operation.</p>\n<p>Not only that but the 2nd of the Queen Elizabeth class Aircraft Carriers will now be kept moth-balled on 'Operational Readiness'. Operational Readiness basically means that it may be ready in 6 months, touch wood. The Falklands conflict lasted what, 74 days?</p>\n<p>I'm not saying the Falklands conflict as such will happen again. After all, Argentina is now a democratic state (ironically as a result of the Falklands war) and wars do not usually happen between democratic states. But what about other tin-pot dictatorships around the world that would like to take a pot-shot at British dependancies? Surely an independent conventional armed force is as important as an independent nuclear deterrent?</p>\n<p>The day I joined HMS Invincible I arrived by Sea King helicopter in the middle of the night to the ship at sea in the Adriatic. It was Operation Deny Flight - enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Later we would be in the Persian Gulf enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq.</p>\n<p>They key thing is, on these lengthy deployments we either took over from, or were relieved by HMS Illustrious, so that the RN could maintain a continuous carrier group within the area. That's no longer possible. Not without the help of allies anyway. Britain will be more dependant on the US Navy than ever before. The US never supported the Falklands campaign if I remember right?</p>\n<p>I noticed the number of surface ships are also being reduced to 29. </p>\n<p>Britannia rules the waves, I think not. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>A few weeks ago I was lucky enough to get an overseas work trip to carry out a <a href=\"/blog/224/pci-qsa\">PCI DSS</a> audit of a client and their service provider in the US. My trip took in LA and Omaha, Nebraska of all places. I travelled with Brad again from the client's security team.\nThe trip started on a high note. We were booked in on premium economy on vAustralia but managed to get bumped up to Business class. </p>\n<p>The service that you get in Business is literally, a different class. As soon as you pick up your Business Class boarding pass you get whisked through the express lane passing the long security and immigration queues. Once on board a glass of champagne is handed to you prior to take-off. Once in the air the stewardess sets up your table with white linen and silver cutlery ready for the meal. After perusing the fine choice of √Ä la carte dishes on the menu the stewardess then brings out some warm bread and butter while you await your first course. Another stewardess brings around a selection of fine wines for you to choose from, and an amazingly nice meal begins. After the meal, the stewardess reminds you to give her a bell when you're ready to have your bed made up, because of course, on Business you get the flat beds.</p>\n<p>On the way out it was a day flight so for most of the journey I either watched movies or visited the bar. It was quite an experience sat at the bar, on a plane! That's certainly one way to pass time on a 14 hour flight. </p>\n<p><strong>Los Angeles</strong></p>\n<p>We arrived at LA at 7am, roughly 4 hours before we left Brisbane due to crossing the international date line in the Pacific. Very bizarre! We managed to get an early check-in for the hotel and got our head down for a few hours before doing a bit of auditing in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>We only had 1 night in LA and had an early flight the next morning, so that night we decided to stay relatively local and took a taxi to Manhattan Beach which was only 15 minutes in a taxi from LAX.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/4867898206\" title=\"View 'Manhattan Beach, LA - 1' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4867898206_0557ec4767_m.jpg\" alt=\"Manhattan Beach, LA - 1\" align=\"left\" /></a></p>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<p>It was a pretty quiet night, being a Monday. We had a few beers and a meal, and later on we met up with one of Brad's mates who was interesting to speak to. As with everyone in LA he's a struggling actor, and when not acting he's a tour manager - having managed the tours of such luminaries as Meatloaf.</p>\n<p>The next day we caught a plane to Salt Lake City, Utah and then a connecting flight to Omaha, Nebraska.</p>\n<p><strong>Omaha, Nebraska</strong></p>\n<p>This was my first time to mid-west America, having only ever visited places on either coasts before. Everyone we met asked the same question - 'why the hell have you come to Omaha?'.</p>\n<p>The week I had in Omaha followed the usual pattern, Drinking all night and a bit of work during the day. Thankfully the client had arranged far more time in Omaha than was necessary to perform the audit so we were able to move at a relaxed pace.</p>\n<p>We had four consecutive nights of going out and drinking until 3 or 4am. It nearly killed me. I had no problem doing that when I was 21, but now I'm 35 the years are taking their toll - and the hangovers are getting worse.</p>\n<p>[googlemaps [maps.google.com.au/maps](https://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=bars+near+old+market,+omaha,+nebraska&amp;sll=41.253549,-95.916996&amp;sspn=0.042717,0.098705&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=bars&amp;hnear=Old+Market,+Douglas,+Nebraska,+United+States&amp;ll=41.259937,-95.931158&amp;spn=0.011291,0.018239&amp;z=15&amp;output=embed&amp;w=425&amp;h=350])</p>\n<p>We spent most nights in the Old Market area of Omaha. This is home to a number of micro-breweries and the selection of pubs and beers is pretty good.</p>\n<p>There's a mistaken opinion in Europe that American beers aren't any good. I suppose it's easy to form that opinion if you've only been to bars that sell Budweiser, Coors or Miller. The bars in Omaha generally had an outstanding selection of beers, both domestic and import. A lot of the bars offered taster plates where you can get a plate of 5 small beer glasses and choose any 5 beers from the menu. We were happy to partake. All of the beers on the menu displayed both the alcohol volume and hop count so you could get a good idea how strong or bitter each beer would be before you tasted it.</p>\n<p>I even found a few bars serving Boddingtons (in cans) and Tetley's on tap. Bliss - the sweet nectar of draught Tetleys. The only place I've been able to get it in Australia as in cans at the British shop in Birkdale, or at the Pig 'n Whistle pub in the city.</p>\n<p>We were hardly ever on our own while we were in Omaha. I guess they don't get many overseas visitors because as soon as we went into a bar and the locals heard our accents we were invariably joined and more often or not they bought us a round of beers. Nebraskans must be amongst the most friendly people I have ever met. </p>\n<p>When they weren't buying us beers, they were buying us shots. The locals seemed to drink shots like they were going out of fashion. I lost count of the rounds of J√§gerbombs we had. A lot of the time the bar man would send a round of shots to our table, on the house. I can't remember ever getting that in the UK or in Australia.</p>\n<p>As well as having good beers, Omaha has great steaks. Nebraska has a reputation for producing some of the finest steaks from grain-fed cows in the country. I can attest that the steaks were huge, juicy and tasty. The best one we had was at <a href=\"http://www.spencersforsteaksandchops.com/omaha/\">Spencer's for Steak and Chops</a>. Not only did we get a great steak, but our waiter gave us biographical information about the cow we were about to eat as well as a detailed run-down on how it is cooked.</p>\n<p><strong>Packing Heat</strong></p>\n<p>On our final day in Omaha our hosts at the service provider I was auditing took us shooting - the favourite pass-time of all good mid-westerners. </p>\n<p>On our way to the shooting range we stopped off at <a href=\"http://www.cabelas.com/la-vista-nebraska-store.shtml\">Cabelas</a> to pick up some ammo. Cabelas itself should be on the tourist map for any overseas visitors. The place is astounding - it has everything you need to start your own war.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/4867275631\" title=\"View 'Cabela's Omaha-1' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4867275631_330ca92fc6_m.jpg\" alt=\"Cabela's Omaha-1\" style=\"margin-right:5px;\" align=\"left\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/4867894022\" title=\"View 'Cabela's Omaha-9' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4867894022_d0b4e20b77_m.jpg\" alt=\"Cabela's Omaha-9\" align=\"left\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/4867276869\" title=\"View 'Cabela's Omaha-5' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4867276869_2cb7a69452_m.jpg\" alt=\"Cabela's Omaha-5\" style=\"margin-right:5px;margin-top:5px;\" align=\"left\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/4867277245\" title=\"View 'Cabela's Omaha-6' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4867277245_1e65b62cd9_m.jpg\" alt=\"Cabela's Omaha-6\" style=\"margin-top:5px;\" align=\"left\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/4867893654\" title=\"View 'Cabela's Omaha-8' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4867893654_5e3d151b2e_m.jpg\" alt=\"Cabela's Omaha-8\" style=\"margin-left:5px;margin-top:5px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<p>Our hosts brought their own guns from home which we could use at the shooting range - a 9mm and a .45 handgun  as well as an AR-15 Assault Rifle.</p>\n<p>When we got the shooting range the guy at the counter told me I couldn't use the AR-15 rounds that I'd purchased. It turns out I had purchased the armour piercing variety and if I was to use them my rounds would go through the wall and out into the parking lot. I exchanged them for some standard .223 rounds that the AR-15 could fire.</p>\n<p>My only previous experience of shooting was the SA-80 Rifle in the Navy, and shotguns when I've been clay-pigeon shooting.</p>\n<p>It's harder than it looks. You would think that you could just line up the sights, pull the trigger and the bullet would be directed exactly where you aim. It's not quite that simple.  On my first few attempts I was all over the place even though I was happy that i had everything lined up as it should be.  Eventually though I remembered my training from the navy - controlled my breathing, stopped snatching at the trigger and fired on the exhale; and before long I was getting some pretty good clusters. The AR-15 came with a scope so it was a case of sending the target right to the back of the range. The surprising thing about the AR-15 is that it has hardly any kick for such a powerful gun.</p>\n<p>My favourite was the .45. Now that does give off a good kick! Even though the thing made me jump out of my skin every time the round exploded from the end of the barrel, I somehow managed to score the best accuracy with it.</p>\n<p>And that's pretty much all I remember from my time in Omaha - drinking and shooting.</p>\n<p>The journey back to Brisbane was a monster. I had to fly Omaha &gt; Salt Lake City &gt; LA &gt;  Sydney &gt; Brisbane. Travel time was about 24 hours but with the time zone change I landed 2 days after I took off. I was in Business class again on the return trip from LA to Sydney, and it was a night flight so I gave the flat bed a try.</p>\n<p>I have this thing that I just can't sleep on planes, and now I'm starting to think it's mainly psychological as even with a flat bed I didn't manage to sleep. I did everything right on the return journey determined to get some sleep: I didn't drink alcohol, I made sure the bed was fully made-up, I put on the blindfold and earmuffs, and I even got changed into some pyjamas they provide for all Business class customers. I didn't get a wink of sleep.</p>\n<p>i don't understand it. When I was in the Navy I used to sleep through force 9 gales, live firing exercises of the .45 inch gun, and even fighter jets landing above me. Maybe it was the guilt I was feeling thinking about all those poor souls back in Economy? No, I don't think it was that.</p>\n<p>See more of my photo's from this trip on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/sets/72157624669877132/\">Flickr</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Last week I was lucky enough to go off on another overseas jolly (err, I mean arduous work trip). This time to Auckland, New Zealand.\nI've never been to NZ before so I was quite looking forward to this one, even if it is the middle of winter and I new it would be freezing.</p>\n<p>We left on Wednesday and arrived quite late. From the minute I arrived in NZ I had to work to stifle my laughter. The accent just kills me. I think I've watched <a href=\"http://www.tv.com/flight-of-the-conchords/show/68719/summary.html?tag=page_nav;subtabs;summary\">Flight of the Conchords</a> too many times. It started as soon as I arrived. I walked through Customs and one of the officials said \"Excuse me sir, I think you've dropped your pin\". I thought <em>pin, what pin? What kind of pin? What's he talking about, I haven't got a pin?</em>. And then I realised - pen, I had dropped my pen. Hence me being in stitches most of the time for the duration of the trip. My favourite has to be \"Would you like to sit on the dick?\", of course referring to the outside deck of one of the bars we visited, which of course came complete with outside heaters given the time of year.</p>\n<p>On the Thursday I did my <a href=\"/blog/224/pci-qsa\">PCI DSS</a> audit as usual, and everything went smoothly. So Thursday night was our (I travelled with Brad from the customer's security team again) first chance to try the Auckland nightlife.</p>\n<p>We stayed in the <a href=\"http://www.thequadrant.com/\">Quadrant Hotel</a> in the city centre, which is a funky little place. The rooms are tiny but they make up for it by offering free Wi-Fi, so I was quite happy. Not that I spent much time in the hotel.</p>\n<p>As usual, we had very good intentions on Thursday night. We actually spoke about it. We realised that the last few places we've been to, we hardly ever managed to get a good meal because we'd always get pissed and side-tracked, completely forget about the restaurant and end up in some dodgy nightclub. So this time, we were determined to get a good meal before anything else.</p>\n<p>We decided to walk down to the Viaduct Harbour area and look for a Seafood restaurant that a taxi driver had recommended earlier that day (because of course, taxi drivers are equivalent to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._A._Gill\">A.A. Gill</a> when it comes to restaurant reviews). It was quite early (around 7pm), so many of the places were mostly empty. It was a bit early to eat so we decided to go get a drink at the nearest bar before we went to the restaurant. That was our first mistake.</p>\n<p>Living in Brisbane now where everyone's in bed by 9pm and up at 5am it's quite nice to go somewhere where the nightlife doesn't even get going until close to midnight. Anyway, that's beside the point.</p>\n<p>So we went to a nearby bar and had a couple of beers. We were sat inside because it was freezing and even with long sleeves on we were clearly under-dressed, warmth-wise. However, it was no warmer inside the bar so we went out on to the dick (sorry, deck) and sat by one of the outside heaters. I of course felt guilty the whole time thinking about the effect on the environment these outside heaters were having. Surely it would be more energy efficient to close the doors and heat the inside to an ambient temperature, rather than run a dozen outside heaters? A couple of beers later and my guilt had passed.</p>\n<p>We left the bar and headed on to the restaurant. The problem with the Viaduct Harbour area and many similar places that we've visited is that it's got a long row of pubs and bars, which are very difficult to just walk past. I remember thinking I wouldn't mind a cocktail before the meal, after getting a taste for cocktails again from the earlier weekend in Singapore and the night in the Sheraton on the Gold Coast with Rach and Lauren the other week. I forgot to write about this. Basically I took a few days leave during Lauren's school holidays and we went to South Bank on the Monday, visiting the <a href=\"http://www.ourbrisbane.com/whats-on/visual-arts/3541470.ron-mueck\">Ron Mueck exhibition at the Gallery of Modern Art</a>, which was truly a sight to behold; spent one night at the <a href=\"http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=372\">Sheraton on the Gold Coast</a> on Tuesday, and then took Lauren to <a href=\"http://movieworld.myfun.com.au/\">Movie World</a> on the Wednesday. Strangely for the school holidays, Movie World was half empty so we had no problem getting on rides. I even went on the <a href=\"http://movieworld.myfun.com.au/Attractions/Rides/SUPERMAN-Escape.htm\">Superman ride</a>, which, after travelling from 0 to 100km per hour in just 2 seconds, I almost regretted. Anyway, I digress.</p>\n<p>So we were sitting there in another bar, Brad with his beer and me with my Mai Tai (looking a bit gay, I know), and we got approached by a man and three women asking if they could join us. We were polite and said ok, but it soon became clear that the reason that they had come over was because one of the women had taken a shining to Brad. Brad let her know that he wasn't interested; he's happily engaged, and besides that, she was that pissed that she couldn't even string a sentence together!</p>\n<p>This is becoming a familiar pattern, and the main reason that we never make it to a restaurant. I don't know how he does it. I've never known anyone get propositioned as much as he does. Some guys tell stories about getting propositioned by air stewardesses on flights. Well I can tell you it happened to him because I was there (Brisbane to Singapore). He also got propositioned by the receptionist at one of the hotels we stayed in; most of the bars we've been to; and unbelievably he even got propositioned before we even got out the taxi when arriving at our hotel in Auckland. We were sat there paying the taxi driver and a group of girls coming out of the hotel shouted through the window and asked us to go out with them on the town (clearly directing there suggestion at Brad). When we said no, they walked away but shouted out their room number to him. Girls these days hey. They weren't like that in my day!</p>\n<p>Anyway, we were polite and the group were really friendly, and it's always good to have a group of locals to show you the best places to go, even if the guy was acting like a pimp most of the time trying to offload his 'ladies' on us. I say 'us', but of course I mean Brad.</p>\n<p>Yet again, the meal was completely forgot about and we ended up in a dodgy place called Cowboys and Indians which is apparently known for its cougars. If only I was single! Just kidding Rach.</p>\n<p>The next morning I woke up with a serious hangover. Luckily I had managed to finish my audit work early so we had some time on the Friday to do some sightseeing.</p>\n<p>Brad has got some mates in Auckland who he worked with when he worked in London a few years ago, and one of them picked us up from the hotel in his car and took us for a drive out.</p>\n<p>We drove up to the west coast (Auckland is on the northern island), to a place called <a href=\"http://www.pihabeach.co.nz/\">Piha</a>. Unfortunately, to get to Piha from Auckland you have to travel up a mountain snaking along some very, very windy roads. This wasn't good for my hangover. I very nearly chucked!</p>\n<p>Piha is stunning, I could tell that even though the weather was atrocious - cold, wet and heavy winds. The weather suited the wildness of the landscape; black volcanic sand beaches and huge cragged rocks protruding from the sea.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/dknkkLY2bE7Qoizlg2knIbaADrGJziQjpSshbvOmxoI?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xoCM_WH2Tzg/Tiv_n_dJk5I/AAAAAAAABAU/VVt9sXJJI8Y/s400/IMG_0053.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/zJHPCLFM-E7NbrfZ9f-0fbaADrGJziQjpSshbvOmxoI?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-M_14n-88I5o/Tiv_hTYB1MI/AAAAAAAABAM/ol8ef36byIU/s400/IMG_0049.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<p>With the weather as it was we stepped out of the car for two minutes to take a a few pics and then quickly retreated back to the warmth of the car. It wasn't long before we were back in Auckland. Brad's mate took us to Ponsonby (funny name, I know) - one of the trendy Auckland suburbs, where we met up with a couple more of his mates and headed to the <a href=\"http://www.longroom.co.nz/\">Long Room</a>, which is one of those pubs I love with leather sofas and open log fires. We spent the rest of the afternoon there warming up by the fire and tasting some of the fine New Zealand wines. Well, only I was on the wines instead of beer because I was still feeling rough from the night before and thought, correctly, that wine would do a better job of enabling a quick recovery from the hangover.</p>\n<p>From there, the rest of the night is a bit of a blur. We just carried on drinking. We got a guided tour of some of the best bars and pubs in Auckland. There were some pretty good ones. I remember one with cuban jazz music, with couples doing the salsa/samba (not sure - I'm not really up on latin dance styles).</p>\n<p>All I really remember is looking at my watch and realising it was 3am and that I'd have to leave for the airport in a few hours. So I said goodbye to everyone (Brad was staying on an extra night) and made my way back to the hotel. And got lost. I seem to have a habit of getting lost in foreign cities. I've lost count of the amount of times, especially when I was in the Navy, of coming out of some strange nightclub on my own and trying to walk back to the hotel/ship, being too tight to pay for a taxi, and getting completely lost.</p>\n<p>On this occasion I even asked a few doormen for directions, which they kindly gave me, and still managed to go wrong. It took me roughly an hour to get back to my hotel, for what should have been a 15 minute walk. When I did finally arrive at the hotel I had 2 hours before I would need to leave for the airport so arranged a wake-up call with reception, the guy on reception giving me that seen-it-all-before smirk. For the second night in a row I'd also somehow managed to lose the key card for my room.</p>\n<p>So that was my first trip to New Zealand. Next stop is Los Angeles and Omaha, Nebraska of all places. Leaving on Monday.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've recently returned from a short work trip that took in Melbourne and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This was the PCI DSS auditing keeping me busy again.\nI travelled with Brad from my customer's security team who I went to Manila and India with. He's from Melbourne so he was quite happy to use the opportunity to catch up with family and friends. We flew down to Melbourne on Monday morning, I did my audit thing as soon as we arrived, and then at night we want for a really nice Italian at a place called Fletchers in Essendon. We met up with Brad's mate and his mate's girlfriend, who were really nice, and then afterwards we went over the road to the Irish pub for a few beers where were joined by his Mum and Aunty. It was a good laugh, especially to watch Brad get embarrassed when his mum started talking about the Cabbage Patch dolls he had as a kid!</p>\n<p>The next day I did some more auditing in the morning before we caught the 3pm flight to Kuala Lumpur. </p>\n<p>I wasn't sure what to expect from KL as unlike with previous trips I didn't do much research. I soon discovered KL is a very modern city, much more akin to Singapore than Manila. Very modern infrastructure. As soon as we arrived at the airport we were whisked into an aerotrain which takes passengers from the international arrivals/departures building to the main terminal.</p>\n<p>Apparently there's a really fast train that takes you straight into the city centre from the airport. That's definitely the best option for anyone traveling to KL as the traffic is mad. We got a taxi from the airport but even at midnight the roads were packed as soon as we got close to the city. It took nearly a hour to get from the airport to the hotel. It was midnight when we arrived.</p>\n<p>On the Wednesday I did my audit stuff during the day - another call centre - and when finished, Scott, the Operations Director of the client I was auditing took us out to show us a bit of KL, which of course meant seeing the sights from the perspective of the nearest bar.</p>\n<p>We dropped our bags off back at the hotel, had a drink at the hotel bar, and then took a walk. He took us first down Jalan Bukit Bintang, which seems to be the 'main drag' in KL, with plenty of shops, restaurants, and also what seemed like plenty of ladies offering different types of massage. It soon became clear that many of the ladies were in fact lady boys, and it wasn't a foot massage that they were offering! So in spite of my aching feet from a hard day's auditing we walked on towards the Pavilion shopping mall. Inside the Pavilion there's a row of bars and restaurants, all of which were offering happy hour. So we had a couple of beers there and then walked in the direction of the Petronas Towers.</p>\n<p>The Petronas Towers look amazing all lit up at night. At the base of the towers there's the large KLCC shopping mall (is it me or is South East Asia just one shopping mall after the next?), with a number of bars outside overlooking the Simfoni Lake, which itself backs on to the KL City Centre Park. The entire area is quite picturesque. The fountains in the lake not too dissimilar to the famous Barcelona Fountains, although not quite as magnificent.</p>\n<p>After having a couple of beers at an Irish pub outside the KLCC we took a walk through the park to the Traders Hotel.</p>\n<p>[googlemaps [maps.google.com.au/maps](https://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=skybar&amp;sll=3.15651,101.714419&amp;sspn=0.006106,0.010782&amp;gl=au&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=skybar&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=3.156499,101.714408&amp;spn=0.006428,0.006437&amp;z=16&amp;output=embed&amp;w=300&amp;h=300])</p>\n<p>The 33rd Floor of the Traders Hotel is home to the Sky Bar. This was Scott's little treat for us and I'm so glad he was with us otherwise I would not have known this existed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-MlnZmffW6GANUuYadJOghLIP1wKrn_uNumzubh416I?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xTBNFLtsXCc/TiwNTrSHcBI/AAAAAAAABHQ/E0aZpIF8sLY/s400/IMG_0036.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Sky Bar is just like one of those GQ experiences you read about. During the day it's the hotel pool. After hours they transform it into a luxury bar. Of course the main sell of the bar is the view - it looks directly out at a full view of both of the twin towers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rl5oTqkELGYwfRcbOcNGnBLIP1wKrn_uNumzubh416I?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tdQslbYRcAM/TiwM-x9JdBI/AAAAAAAABHE/ZO6bj25cbj0/s400/IMG_0032.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<p>Having a swimming pool in the middle of the bar is very strange. No one was swimming in it, the place is far too cool for that. The bar oozes sophistication. The lighting was just right, and so was the music, with a DJ playing an eclectic set of dance tracks, and what's more the menu was delicious. We went for the Tapas, ordering a selection of calamari, chicken satay, samosas, etc. Everything was really well-prepared and came with gorgeous dips and garnish.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wiOIxJU2r0Elx_kPwZeqfBLIP1wKrn_uNumzubh416I?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u_X5JHWVBc8/TiwOjBHK5kI/AAAAAAAABIY/cfMEjEQ-XKY/s400/IMG_0062.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<p>It wasn't cheap, and at the end of the night Scott picked up the bill for the lot! Bless him. I guess that's the beauty of being a Director working out in Malaysia but being paid in the Aussie dollar. I think he was glad of the company. All of his staff are locals, and with Malaysia being largely a muslim country he doesn't get to drink with his staff.  </p>\n<p>We thought about going up the Petronas Towers, now the 4th tallest building in the world, but the fact is the best thing to look at in KL is the twin towers. It's not like <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/sets/72057594071616080/\">when I went up the Empire State Building in New York</a>, surrounded by iconic buildings in every direction.</p>\n<p>On the Thursday I got through the rest of my auditing, finishing mid-afternoon. We got a taxi from the office straight to the KLCC to do a spot of shopping. It wasn't long before we were both sick of shopping so soon found ourselves in the Irish pub again playing a few games of pool.</p>\n<p>After a few beers at the Irish pub we decided to drop our bags off at the hotel and go out and find a restaurant for a traditional Malay meal. The following morning we had to leave at 6am to catch our flight so we were going to be sensible and get back at a reasonable hour. That was the plan anyway.</p>\n<p>We left the hotel and had a walk back down Jalan Bukit Bintang. We wandered into an undercover area following a path to what looked like a group of restaurants. On the way we got beckoned towards another bar in the midst of happy hour. This was one of those circular bars similar to the one Tom Cruise's character tenders in Jamaica in the film Cocktail (I love that film).</p>\n<p>The beers started flowing again, and we got talking to a couple of Aussie backpackers to our right, who were on the first night of their trip before flying off to Europe, as well as a British expat to our left, who now lives in Perth but was about to join an oil rig off the coast of Malaysia. </p>\n<p>A few drinks later and before we knew it we had completely forgotten about our restaurant plans and instead found ourselves in a taxi with our new set of mates and the two girls from the bar on our way to a nightclub.</p>\n<p>They had wanted to take us to the infamous Beach Club Caf√©, but given this place was known to be frequented by many ladies of the 'love you long time' variety, both myself and Brad thought it wouldn't be a good idea. We're both getting married in the next few months and Rach for certain would perform a <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bobbit\">bobbit</a> on me if she found out.</p>\n<p>Looking the place up now it seems we went to a club just along the road from the Beach Club Caf√©. There's a street behind the Petronas Towers that's home to a number of nightclubs. I think the one we went to was called <a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps/place?cid=2771328938967407321&amp;q=nightclubs+near+97+Jalan+P+Ramlee&amp;gl=au&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=10&amp;ei=NeoBTP3HMYPeoATVoI3CBw&amp;sig2=oW142Qdp29avcfX92edbLg&amp;dtab=0&amp;sll=3.155075,101.708615&amp;sspn=0.005699,0.010782&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;iwloc=J\">S.I.N</a>.</p>\n<p>My memory of the rest of the evening is a bit fuzzy. I know we had a fantastic time. It was one of the best nights out I've had in a long time. </p>\n<p>There was a really good live band on. Just like Manila it was a good mix of live music with the DJ playing dance tracks in-between sets. At one point I realised I was running out of cash so I had a walk out to find an ATM with Brad. For some reason the ATM kept rejecting both our cards so we staggered back expecting to only have enough for a couple of more beers. Shortly after getting back in the club though some random guy came and placed a large bucket of Carlsberg beers on a table next to where the group of us were dancing and told us to help ourselves.  After drinking those he then went and fetched another bucket. What a fella! I realised later that he may have had ulterior motives as he seemed far more interested in making friends with the males in our group than the females. Oh well, the things we'll do for a beer!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PDlfkAXcvoLbxFZ0phcJbhLIP1wKrn_uNumzubh416I?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UA2JDq1gA-o/TiwPY3nkSdI/AAAAAAAABJI/2o3AegAz8S4/s144/IMG_0092.JPG\" /></a> <a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ApKgR_Ufy52AL9VvWdX85RLIP1wKrn_uNumzubh416I?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qPVxvfchxBU/TiwPzl8_Q4I/AAAAAAAABJk/fHHBUUMFmRw/s144/IMG_0099.jpg\" /></a> <a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LLRQ4es1Co7Og-6x81JxtxLIP1wKrn_uNumzubh416I?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KeYACQanw3w/TiwPshm1U5I/AAAAAAAABJc/NGa8rtxgOJo/s144/IMG_0098.JPG\" /></a> <a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/75sKLaMEtUl9nHaB3AajJhLIP1wKrn_uNumzubh416I?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NmsINQW6J1A/TiwPoa1Qh-I/AAAAAAAABJY/9ejS8cUbJ5U/s144/IMG_0097.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<p>It's fair to say I partied like it was 1999 (except I didn't party in 1999 but that's a different story). It's a long time since I've been to a nightclub and stayed until the lights came on at the end.</p>\n<p>We got back to the hotel at 4:30am. So much for the quiet night out! We never did end up having a traditional Malay meal.</p>\n<p>I managed to get an hour's kip before we had to leave for the airport. As the taxi was waiting downstairs I had to knock on Brad's door and wake him up. He was in a worst state than me, he hadn't even packed.</p>\n<p>We got to the airport still really drunk. I was also partially deaf from the nightclub. It would be another 2 hours before my ears stopped ringing. We boarded the flight trying to appear as sober as we could. </p>\n<p>We then sat on the tarmac for an hour going nowhere before they told us that there was a mechanical issue with the plane so we had to go back to the terminal and wait for further instructions.</p>\n<p>We ended up being delayed for 4 hours, but in retrospect it was a god-send as it allowed us to get our head's down on the comfy sofas in the Malaysian Air Lounge. It's the first time I had been in a lounge for one of the international airlines and it's a shame that I was dying, because the facilities are amazing. A buffet with a good selection of hot and cold food, a well-stocked bar including champagne and spirits, relaxation rooms, putting room (yes, a room to practice your golf putting) and other features, all free! Unfortunately, we were in no condition to make the most of it.</p>\n<p>I finally arrived home shortly after midnight on the Friday night / Saturday morning. After only having 1 hour's sleep in the past 48 hours I felt like a zombie on Saturday.</p>\n<p>It was a short but memorable trip. </p>\n<p>When I was in the Navy one of my biggest regrets is that of all the fantastic places I visited, I would often only travel as far as the bar closest to the port. Since leaving the Navy I've tried to make up for that by taking Rach to New York, Rome, Barcelona, etc where we've done the complete tourist thing. </p>\n<p>With these work trips I seem to be regressing.</p>\n<p>See more of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/sets/72157624122096228/\">my photo's from Kuala Lumpur on Flickr</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It's decision time. Millions of voters are now heading to the polls in the UK to cast their vote. Many of us expats have probably missed out on voting because the postal vote system doesn't allow enough time to register and then get our vote off from the other side of the world.\nIt's been an interesting few weeks in the election campaign and tomorrow could be even more interesting. In fact it could be chaos if it's a hung parliament as the polls suggest.</p>\n<p>Since I'm too young to remember the last hung parliament in Britain it's interesting to see the process and the various scenarios that may play out.</p>\n<p><strong>A Well-Hung Parliament\n</strong></p>\n<p>If it's a hung parliament the ball is in Gordon Brown's court. He could choose to stay on as PM and try and form a minority government. That looks unlikely to happen though based on what Nick Clegg has been saying. Nick Clegg has indicated that he would support the party with the biggest mandate, and as he's in favour of proportional representation you could guess that he means the party with the most number of votes, not necessarily seats. So surely that means he would support the Conservatives if the election turns out as the polls predict.</p>\n<p>It may of course be likely that the Conservatives get the largest share of the votes and the largest number of seats, but not enough seats to get a majority. In this case surely GB would step down and the Queen would invite David Cameron to become PM? The problem will then arise when the Conservatives want to push through their legislative programme in the Queen's Speech. If they don't have a working majority of votes to pass the legislation they could get a vote of no-confidence from the other parties, in which case we may be looking at another election.</p>\n<p>The magic number is 326 seats. However in reality the Conservatives could get a working majority with 310 seats if there are a number of Independents, and Sinn Fein have stated that they won't take their seats. Plus the DUP is expected to join the Conservatives in a coalition if required.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ups and Downs of an Election Campaign\n</strong></p>\n<p>The election campaign has been fascinating to follow. I'm one of those geeks who likes to read the manifestos and watch each of the leadership debates (which only re-affirmed my previous choice of party).</p>\n<p>The overall story of the election campaign is surely the demise of Labour. They must be due for a good kicking in the election? Bigot-gate was a funny development but I don't think it's made that much difference to the polls.</p>\n<p>The first television debate was certainly a tipping point in the election. Who would have thought before then that the Lib Dems would poll as high as Labour? Nick Clegg certainly did well to cast his party as a complete alternative to the two 'old' parties. It looks like many people were convinced. It seems many are less convinced now they've delved into the Lib Dem policies!</p>\n<p>The polls from the third leadership debate gave it to Cameron but I wasn't so sure. I was left disappointed by his failure to answer some of the questions, which is a strategy usually more akin to GB than DC. It must have been a tactical decision to avoid direct questions from GB as I knew he had answers. I've heard him directly answer the questions in other QA's about regional development agencies and child tax credit, etc, and give a good rationale to the policy decisions, so I couldn't understand why he avoided directly tackling the accusations from GB.</p>\n<p>The online YouTube/Facebook debate gave Nick Clegg a clear win. Not surprising really, the demographic of facebook and youtube was always going to be more advantageous to the Liberal Democrats. They're the rebel party; the party of ideals. I'm all for idealisms but sometimes you have to mix that with a little pragmatism as well. Proportional Representation (PR) is a good example of why pragmatism should sometimes come ahead of ideals.</p>\n<p><strong>Proportional Representation\n</strong></p>\n<p>It's the ultimate democratic method of voting, but paradoxically leads to the most undemocratic governments. Countries with PR tend to go through governments like Manchester City goes through managers. Coalition governments are the order of the day which invariably means deals done behind closed doors and no strong policy decisions.</p>\n<p>I think David Cameron has the best idea. Keep the first past the post system so that the link between MPs and constituencies is maintained, but change the size of the constituencies so that all constituencies have an equal proportion of the overall vote. That way the proportion of seats will equal the proportion of the vote, and there wouldn't be the situation we have today where Labour could get less votes but still have a majority of seats.</p>\n<p>The polls close at 7am tomorrow our time so I'll be up early on my day off watching with interest,and hope of a new team in charge.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It's now been just over a month since we moved into our new house, so yes, since the last post things did work out ok in the end.\nWe managed to get the house in Alexandra Hills that we liked. Apparently there were 6 other applicants so we did quite well to get it. The effort we made to put in the best application possible definitely paid off.</p>\n<p>After we moved in, we then had a battle to get our out of pocket expenses back from the estate agents who had messed us about with the Manly house. At first they only wanted to cover half of the expenses but we stuck to our guns and they eventually came good.</p>\n<p>Anyway that all seems like ancient history now. Better to look forwards than backwards.</p>\n<p>We're loving the house. For the first time we're living in a rental where we can actually make changes, decorate and hang our pictures. You wouldn't believe what difference it makes. We (or should I say Rach) has already decorated Lauren's room, with Lauren choosing the colours and design. Needless to say it's predominantly pink!</p>\n<p>The house is roughly 20 years old so there's a few issues here and there but the estate agent and owners are working through them for us.</p>\n<p>A brand new challenge for us is pool maintenance. We ignored it for the first couple of weeks, by which time the pool had turned completely green due to algae. So we got the owner round to show us what to do. After he showed us what's required I thought sod that. Now knowing the time and effort required I quickly decided we'd 'get a man in'. Unfortunately for Rach the pool boy who turned up wasn't quite what she had in mind. It's going to cost $80 a month to have the pool maintained but time is money and all that. Same goes for the garden. If it was just mowing a lawn then I'd happily do that myself but our new house has got quite a bit of landscaping, and seeing as though most of the time I can't tell the difference between a weed and a plant I've decided to outsource that as well. Yes, I really am a lazy arse.</p>\n<p>So this house is costing us a bit more than originally planned. Plus, it's further away from work. It's about 1 hours and 20 minutes door to door. It's all worth it though.</p>\n<p>Lauren is loving her new school so that's a big relief. We hated having to move her again but she never really settled at her last school and she's already got a better set of friends than she had before, so she's quite happy.</p>\n<p>I think we're going to enjoy it here. Then again I said that this time last year when we moved to Wakerley.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>We're moving out of our house on Thursday. The only problem is we haven't yet got a home to move to.\nThings were great with our current house to begin with. We're a short walk away from a park and our house backed on to woods so we could wake up to the sound of Kookaburras in the morning. </p>\n<p>Then a few months ago we were suddenly awoken by the sounds of bulldozers. The woods across from our house has now gone and is being replaced by an estate compromising 62 houses. The noise is horrendous from 6:30am every weekday and even some Saturdays. Not only that but we're getting a constant stream of dust coming into the house from the construction site. It's not good.</p>\n<p>Our rent came up for renewal so we decided it was time to move again. It's not just the construction site that's the problem. I haven't been able to get ADSL since we've been here so I ended up getting Satellite broadband, which is only any good when we've got clear skies, and it's not cheap. Trying to run an internet business from home with an unreliable internet service is not ideal to say the least. We're also in poor signal area to use 3G broadband. Rachelle has now given up her job and works for our business full-time so it's particularly important that we've got a good connection.</p>\n<p>So we made the decision to move out and found a fantastic house in Manly. It's a bit smaller than our current house, only having 2 bedrooms, but it's only 200 metres from the water (Moreton Bay) and close to Cambridge Parade which has a good selection of quality restaurants.  We applied, got accepted, lodged a deposit and signed the Tenancy Agreement. All set to move in this Thursday.</p>\n<p>On Thursday afternoon we received a phone call from the estate agent to inform us that the owners of the house we are moving to have changed their mind and now want to move into their house. Some story about the husband having an accident in India leaving him paraplegic so they've decided to return home to Brisbane and live in that house. Whether it's true or not I don't know. If it is, I'm truly sorry for being so cynical and I feel for them, but I don't understand why someone who's paraplegic would want to return to a 3 storey townhouse. It all sounds a bit fishy to me.</p>\n<p>So begins the nightmare. We've signed a tenancy agreement and given notification to leave our current place, so legally we've got a signed contract that's binding which allows us to live in the Manly house for the next 6 months. We spoke to the Residential Tenancies Authority (RTA) who administer the Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act, and who have powers to resolve disputes and issue fines, and they confirmed we‚Äôre legally in our rights to take up the residency.</p>\n<p>The thing is, the owners have the keys, not the estate agents, and if we did move in they could kick us out again in 6 months time, which being 3 weeks before we get married would not be the best of timing.  So we‚Äôve been madly looking for somewhere else. The problem is compounded by the fact we have no option but to move out of our current house on Thursday as since we gave notification to leave, the owners signed a tenancy agreement with someone else.</p>\n<p>We crammed in as many viewings as we could this weekend and have found a house we love in Alexandra Hills for which we've lodged an application. Fingers crossed, but with the rental market the way it is at the moment we've got a lot of competition for the house. We've pulled out all the strings to provide the best application we can, including a cover letter selling why we'd make great tenants, great references, more than the 100 points ID, full records of our previous rental payments and good inspection reports, etc. Of course, our competition could have done exactly the same. We should find out tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Even if we get the house, it‚Äôs not available until the 1st April. Luckily some friends have offered to put us up but we‚Äôll have to move all our stuff into storage for a few days. We‚Äôve told the estate agents of the Manly house that we expect the owners who have messed us about to cover any of our out of pocket expenses, including storage costs and the extra removal costs moving our stuff from storage to the new house.</p>\n<p>We're currently up to our necks in boxes packing for the move. This should be an exciting time, moving into a new house. Instead, we're completely demotivated because we have no idea where or when we'll have our own house again.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>We're getting closer to General Election time again in the UK and as I'm still a British citizen and eligible to vote, my interest in British politics remains. Don't ask me why, I just can't seem to switch it off.\nWith Twitter, Google Reader and iphone apps providing an ever constant news feed, being on the other side of the world no longer means that we expats are out of touch with events in the motherland.</p>\n<p>With the election looming ever closer it's interesting to see how the media is reporting political stories and portraying the three main parties. Very few of the newspapers or TV networks can honestly claim to be non-partisan but at least they make the pretence of being fair and balanced. Some manage it more successfully than others.</p>\n<p>So it's been particular interesting this week to see the reporting over Lord Ashcroft's admission of his non-dom status. </p>\n<p>As expected, the unashamedly left wing papers have made a big thing of it, covering the story on the front pages.  And then there's the BBC.</p>\n<p>I hold the BBC in high regard. The BBC news website is always the main source of international news for me. It generally has high editorial standards and, in most cases, can truly claim to be fair and balanced.</p>\n<p>I am aware, however, that the BBC gets a lot of stick and is continuously accused of being too sympathetic towards Labour.  I remember reading My Trade: A Short History of British Journalism by Andrew Marr who tacked this accusation by saying BBC editorial policy per se is not biased towards Labour, it's just that the BBC happens to attract a lot of left-leaning journalists so there ends up being a de-facto bias towards Labour. Or words to that effect.</p>\n<p>So with a strong editorial policy you would hope that any inherent bias in a story would get a re-write by the editor before being published, and when it comes to political stories, you would hope that the editing would be top-notch particularly when the political parties have started campaigning for election.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Lord Ashcroft story the editorial policies have clearly failed.  Why haven't the BBC put equal emphasis on Labour's Lord Paul and other Labour peers who are non-doms and large donors to the Labour party. Same goes with the Lib Dems.  Lord Paul has even reportedly stated that he would rather give up his seat in the Lords than change his non-dom status.</p>\n<p>Some of the BBC stories have been quite misleading and the reader could be led to believe that he's been avoiding paying any tax for the last 10 years and completely props up the Conservative party, which simply isn't true. He's paid tax to the Inland Revenue on his UK earnings, he probably will have paid tax to another country on his oversees earnings (as most countries have a double-taxation agreement in place with Britain so that those earning income in the UK and overseas don't have to get taxed twice on the same income), and furthermore his contributions to the Tories have accounted for less than 1% of donations this year.</p>\n<p>Alan Johnson, the Home Secretary, has accused Michael Ashcroft of being unpatriotic. The same Michael Ashcroft who formed Crimestoppers, has raised millions for Help for Heroes and many other charities; and donated his Victoria Cross collection to the Imperial War Museum. That doesn't sound unpatriotic to me.</p>\n<p>At least the BBC are 100 times more fair and balanced than the network that has Fair and Balanced as its byline - Fox News. </p>\n<p>If I was American I'd be embarrassed to have Fox News as the country's biggest cable news network. This is a 'Fair and Balanced' news network that employes Republican governers, takes every opportunity it can to label Obama a marxist or communist, and even goes as far as organising rallies against government policy (the Tea Party rallies). Aren't they supposed to report the news not make it? Fox News is akin to the V√∂lkischer Beobachter - the newspaper of the Nazi Party.</p>\n",

				"title": "Manila to India",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I've recently returned from a work trip which included my first ever visits to the Philippines and India.\nThe purpose of the trip was to carry out a <a title=\"PCI Security Standards\" href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/index.shtml\">PCI DSS</a> audit for one of my clients. As is the way these days my client has outsourced their call centre to a company in Manila, and have also outsourced some application support to another company in New Delhi, India.  The thing about PCI DSS is that if you outsource work, you can only be validated as compliant if your service providers are also compliant, which is what I had to check.</p>\n<p>For a change I wasn't traveling on my own this time. Brad from my client's security team came along with me. It actually worked out quite well as he, like me, likes a beer (or two) so we got on great. The only problem was he's an Arsenal fan ;-)</p>\n<p>We left Brisbane on the Monday morning and flew to Singapore. We had a couple of hours at Singapore Airport and then flew to Manila. Singapore Airport has got to be one of the best airports in the world. With free wi-fi and xbox 360 the time can really fly!</p>\n<p>The first thing I noticed about Manila was the traffic. It's by no means the first country I've visited where traffic laws seem to be non-existant but it was still a sight to behold. Talk about everyone for themselves.  Surely if someone just sat the country down and explained to them that if they only followed a few basic rules of the road they would all get to their destination a lot quicker.</p>\n<p>The second thing I noticed was the security. As well as seeing police on every corner I was surprised to find that to enter our hotel, the Holiday Inn, we had to pass through a metal detector. It wasn't just our hotel it was like that everywhere. Not just the hotels but the Malls as well. And boy are there a lot of malls! As well as the metal detectors pretty much all of the shops had guards on the door, many of them armed. It was a bit disconcerting walking into Starbucks with two armed guards on the door.</p>\n<p>I really wasn't expecting that level of security everywhere. After all the Philippines is predominantly a Catholic country so hasn't had the problems that other countries in the region have had such as Indonesia. I questioned one of our contacts in Minala about the situation and he just answered \"Well, it's an election year\".  Reading up on it now I see that the Philippines has had a history of trouble with militant groups so the heavy security everywhere is an effort by the Government to remove this threat. The policy seems to be working.</p>\n<p>Work-wise the Manila visit ended up being a waste of time. The first thing I have to do when I start an audit is to properly define the scope. The scope for a PCI DSS audit in simple terms is any system that processes, stores or transmits cardholder data. However, it's not quite that simple. What many of my clients have trouble understanding is that I may have to include other systems within the scope of my audit that have nothing to do with processing credit card data, if those systems have not been completely separated, at a network level, from the systems that are in-scope. It's got to be proper network segmentation which usually means using a firewall to control traffic between networks and network segments. As an auditor I can't just take their word for it, I have to do a physical inspection of the network and firewall configuration to verify that they have indeed separated their cardholder data systems from the rest.</p>\n<p>So this is usually the first thing that I check. This sets the scope for the rest of the audit. If everything's properly segregated then I may only have to look at a couple of systems. But if they haven't implemented network segmentation then their whole network could be in-scope and I could choose to sample as many systems as I like. When it comes to sampling it all depends on what confidence I can get that they've secured their systems in a standardised way to the same level. For instance, if they've got 50 PC's that they all build with an identical image and they apply the exact same security to all 50 and the users haven't got rights to change any of the settings, they I may only need to sample one PC. On the sample principle, if they build all their PC's, servers, routers, etc independently with different settings then I may need to choose a large sample.</p>\n<p>I always try and warn clients about the rules regarding scoping and sampling as I often end up having a battle when I tell them I need to audit a system that has nothing to do with processing credit card data.</p>\n<p>Anyway... The reason the Manila visit ended up being a waste of time was because their security team at their US headquarters had a problem with me looking at their firewall and servers. Not sure what they had to hide. They had plenty of advance notice of our visit so I really don't know why the issue couldn't have been sorted out before I arrived. We spent two days waiting while the local Managers in Manila tried to negotiate with the team in the US to allow me access. We even put our flight out back 24 hours to give them more time but in the end it still wasn't sorted out. I did what I could so the trip wasn't a complete waste of time. I audited some areas which I knew would definitely be in scope whether I looked at the firewall or not. But in the end no firewall access means I couldn't determine the scope which meant I couldn't complete the audit.</p>\n<p>In the mean-time while this was all going on we had a couple of cracking nights out in Manila. The nightlife there really is quality.</p>\n<p>The first night we just went out to a local restaurant called the Banana Leaf, where, as the name suggests, you eat your meal off a banana leaf. After that we went to a local bar which had had some live entertainment.  After a band, a group of women calling themselves the Mucho Girls came on. They were like a Filipino version of the Pussycat Dolls. And you know what, they were really good!</p>\n<p>The second night we had out in Manila we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. This is a bit of a thing for me going back to my Navy days. Whenever we were in a major city around the world we always headed for the Hard Rock Cafe. Don't ask me why.</p>\n<p>Unlike most Hard Rock Cafe's I've been in around the world this one wasn't full of shit-faced sailors.  What it was full of was middle aged and older men, mainly Americans, with young Filipino girls that they had purchased for the evening/day/week, or in one case according to a guy Brad talked to, 3 weeks. It was all a bit sad really.  We were just happy to play pool.</p>\n<p>There was one thing about Manila, and the Manila Hard Rock Cafe was representative of this, that set it apart from all the other places I've visited in the world - namely the amount of staff. Being the 12th most populated country in the world there are a lot of people, and in Manila they seem to go out of their way to give as many people as possible jobs. Unnecessarily so in many cases.</p>\n<p>Wherever you go in Manila there seems to be more staff on than really necessary. You go into a shop and there's often more staff than customers. In hotels and office buildings there seems to be a porter in every lift. In the office buildings I visited there were not only guards on the building reception but there were also guards on the entrance doors to every floor. Now this makes for great customer service. Sometimes it can be a little annoying though, like in the shops when you're browsing (the exchange rate makes Manila a great place to shop) and the staff, thinking they're being attentive, follow you around everywhere and stand at your side when you're looking at stuff. If you reach to take an item of clothing off a rack, for instance, they'll try and beat you to it so that their customers don't have to go through the indignity of having to take clothes off of a rack themselves. It's all very bizarre. They must be the friendliest people in the world though. You lose count when walking through a mall of how many times you hear \"Hi Sir\", \"Hello Sir\", \"Good Morning Sir\".</p>\n<p>In the case of the Hard Rock Cafe, this over-staffing issue resulted in us having our very own guy to look after our pool table. We didn't ask for him he was just assigned to us as soon as we started playing pool. He'd rack the table for us. If the white went down he'd retrieve it for us and replace it on the table (I was slightly disappointed he wasn't wearing a white glove and didn't inspect and dust the ball each time before replacing it), and each time we needed a drink he'd happily go off to the bar to fetch us another. This was all to easy. All, I should say, for less than $1 AU a game.</p>\n<p>About 12 pints later when we realised we were struggling to hit a ball straight we went through to the other room to have a meal and watch the band.</p>\n<p>When we were playing pool there was this great band on TV. They were doing cover versions of Black Eyed Peas songs and other recent hits. They were that good that at first before glancing at the TV I didn't realise that they were a cover band. It took me ever longer to realise that the band on TV were in fact playing in the room next door. I'm a bit slow on the take-up these days.</p>\n<p>So we went through and had something to eat. The band went off and then who should come on stage... none other than Manila's very own Mucho Girls. They were following us!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/QfQdNZxabaqJkRUxwy00kTzzZJjN8fHaqXqIYgIHw30?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ctpvXFQijkM/TjUfVRbNoWI/AAAAAAAABUo/eJ7KHujfohk/s400/DSC00231.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<p>The next day I felt very ill. Before you think it was really unprofessional of me going out drinking when I'm working the next day, in my defence we didn't have to start work until the afternoon. None of the staff were available to speak to me before the afternoon. I think they must be working on US time or something to align with their US counterparts but they started work in the afternoon and worked through until really late.</p>\n<p>At first I thought I just had an hangover. I had stomach cramps and the runs and just presumed it was something to do with the lake of beer I had consumed the night before. When I was still the same 24 hours later I realised it probably wasn't the cause of the beer. I was ill for the rest of the trip and then some.</p>\n<p>We left Manila on the Friday and headed to Singapore for the weekend. The client very nicely put us up in Singapore for the weekend so we could fly straight to India ready for Monday.</p>\n<p>As soon as I got the hotel I went straight to bed as I felt awful. I still had stomach cramps but then I started to get cold sweats. I couldn't get warm. I had the air-con turned off (it was over 30 degrees and 100% humidity) and the quilt doubled over on top of me but I couldn't stop shaking. I finally got off to sleep and woke up the next morning feeling a little better. Through the night I had sweated that much that the bedding looked like someone had soaked it in a bath and then crumpled it up in heap on the bed.</p>\n<p>It was nice to have the Saturday to chill out and not do anything. I was determined to not let the side down and get myself right so I could have a night out with Brad that Saturday night.</p>\n<p>Before the trip, on the advice of the client, I had been to the Travel Doctors to get a load of shots (6 in all) for India, and they also gave me a 'Gastro pack'. This is basically a travel pack containing anti-biotics, re-hydration tablets, etc and a travel health booklet. I took a few tablets through the day and just drank water, and come the evening I felt much better. There was no way I was going to miss a night out in Singapore.</p>\n<p>To start the evening we did the touristy thing and headed to the Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel for a Singapore Sling. I had been to Singapore with Rach and Lauren before but having Lauren with us we never made it to the Long Bar.</p>\n<p>I must say I'm not usually that bothered about cocktails but the Singapore Sling tastes amazing. We had two of them, although when we got the bill we had a bit of a shock. $24 each, i.e. per cocktail!</p>\n<p>We then took a rickshaw down to the Riverside - Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, where there's a large collection of riverside restaurants and bars. The poor guy sure worked for his money cycling with us two on the back. He had a right sweat on by the time we arrived. He also tried to charge us a fortune for the privilege. We haggled him down to a reasonable price but it still would have been cheaper getting a taxi. We also looked like a gay couple on the back of the rickshaw being given a guided tour of Singapore!</p>\n<p>We started off at a pub and watched a bit of Premier League footie, and then chose a Japanese restaurant to get some scran. The food was great but I couldn't eat that much as I still felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach.</p>\n<p>In hindsight drinking alcohol while I was still clearly ill and after taking anti-biotics wasn't a good idea. The next day the runs had returned.</p>\n<p>We had an early evening flight to India on the Sunday so went for a whistle-stop tour of Singapore on Sunday afternoon to take a few pics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xGg-sA5O_z54ka2UJhWM8TzzZJjN8fHaqXqIYgIHw30?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FZ3RGySYTTw/TjUYvwTK64I/AAAAAAAABQ0/CZi-LoNaZRc/s400/IMG_0025.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<p>I really like Singapore. It's not as cheap as the Philippines, Thailand or other parts of South East Asia but you also don't get any of the traffic chaos and you don't risk damaging your digestive system when you go for a meal. In fact, they drive better in Singapore than they do in Brisbane. It's all very civilized. The strict health and safety laws in Singapore also means that all of the restaurants and other food retailers must display a health certificate grading it from A to D.</p>\n<p>It was a little bit different to New Delhi, that's for sure.</p>\n<p>It was my first time in India - my only prior knowledge of India mainly from watching Slumdog Millionaire.  I know Slumdog Millionaire was mainly set in Mumbai but that film made it look like paradise compared to what I saw.</p>\n<p>Immediately from arriving at the Ghandi International Airport I knew we'd be in for a culture shock.</p>\n<p>We had been assigned a driver by the company we were visiting so on exiting the Arrivals lounge we looked for our names amongst the  huge group of signs being held up by other  drivers. We slowly walked past them all but couldn't see our names. We  hung about outside for a while figuring he might be running late and every now and again went and walked the line of drivers holding signs to check we hadn't missed ours.</p>\n<p>We thought about just getting a taxi but when I went to try and find the taxi rank all I could find was mini-cab drivers. I couldn't find any official taxis or even taxi rank like you get in most city airports.</p>\n<p>After a while a couple of Indian guys approached me and asked if I needed help saying they had noticed that we'd been waiting ages. Obviously I was a bit wary of a couple of strangers approaching me out of the blue for no good reason and held on tight to my luggage. Well, you hear stories don't you! They were actually really friendly. They told me they were Australians and advised me never to get one of the mini-cabs as you never know where you might end up. They also told me that our driver might be waiting for us at the other exit. What! There are two exits! I couldn't believe it. We had been waiting about an hour by that time without realising that there was a second exit. It was also well past midnight.</p>\n<p>We toddled off to the other exit and sure enough our driver was there holding the sign. He didn't look very happy. We realised later in the trip that that was just his face. As we approached him he put his hand out so I reached my hand out to shake his hand but what he was actually doing was reaching out to take my bags. I did feel like an idiot!</p>\n<p>It took nearly an hour to get to our Hotel which was in Noida, an industrial and business area north of New Delhi, chosen for the proximity to the company I was visiting. As it was dark I couldn't really see much of our surroundings.</p>\n<p>We stayed at the Park Plaza Hotel in Noida. The hotel was really nice, as nice as any I have stayed in. I can't quite say the same about the location though.</p>\n<p>When we arrived at the airport the first thing I noticed was that the visibility in the terminal didn't seem quite right. It seemed really smoky. I couldn't really smell smoke but there was definitely something in the air. I presumed it was just smog that had infiltrated the airport terminal. Again when we got to the hotel the hotel also seemed to be full of smog. This time it did smell more like smoke though.</p>\n<p>The next morning I woke up and opened the curtains to get my first proper glimpse of India and the result was nothing. Zero visibility. It was like a thick cloud had descended and smothered the entire city. I presumed this was really bad smog. With a population of 12 million in New Delhi I was half expecting it.</p>\n<p>I was wrong. Later in the day it started to clear, and I spoke to our hosts who told us that it was fog. It happens every year in that region of India about the same time. The smoky smell I was getting in the hotel was just due to the fact that it's not a non-smoking hotel. They don't even have any non-smoking rooms. Every morning that week there was zero visibility until the fog cleared later in the day. It's a good job we had evening flights as all planes were grounded in the morning.</p>\n<p>When the fog eventually cleared this is what I saw out of my hotel window:</p>\n<p><a title=\"IMG_0081 by darylhai, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/4339504633/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/4339504633_7281cb0daf.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0081\" /></a></p>\n<p>Not exactly the Taj Mahal.</p>\n<p>Although the hotel was luxury it was quite a shock to find it was situated smack bang in the middle of a residential area.</p>\n<p>As we left the hotel to head to the office the sights and sounds were overwhelming.</p>\n<p>On the sides of every road were tents and corrugated iron shelters housing people. Many of these were across the road from relatively wealthy homes. The contrast between rich and poor living side-by-side was startling. People seem to do everything at the side of the road. They live at the side of the road, eat, sell goods and inevitably shit and piss at the side of the road. We lost count of the amount of people we saw happily taking a piss at the side of the road.</p>\n<p>Besides the road-side dwellings there were also plenty of slums that seemed to sprawl all over the landscape.</p>\n<p>The roads were also an experience. We thought Manila was bad but that was nothing compared to India. At least Manila had things like traffic lights, even if most people ignore them.</p>\n<p>The roads were full of potholes and no one stuck to a lane. In most cases there weren't any proper lanes. The traffic pretty much crawled everywhere. Every now and then we'd get going and then we'd suddenly have to stop for a cow in the middle of the road. Every time we did stop we'd get old ladies or kids, no older than Lauren, running out tapping on the car windows begging.</p>\n<p>I really felt awful. I wasn't sure whether I should give something to them or not. The driver made a point each time we left the hotel or office of immediately using the central locking to lock all the doors and made sure all the windows were fully up. Much like Manila, security in Delhi is taken very seriously. I couldn't help feeling guilty all the time I was there. Seeing all that poverty really puts things into perspective. In Britain and Australia people moan about being poor but even the poor have a proper roof above their head and get at least 2000 calories a day. The poor in Britain and Australia just have to shop at Netto (just kidding).</p>\n<p>So was this a life-changing experience making me want to give up my capitalist materialistic ways? Maybe for a couple of days... and then I saw the Apple iPad announcement!</p>\n<p>Throughout our trip there were regular power cuts. Both at the hotel and office there were regular power interruptions. The office had their server room on a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) as is normal for most companies, but they didn't extend this to the office environment. I'm surprised half of the equipment isn't fried.  We had a morning of repeated power cuts in Brissie a few weeks ago which has resulted in knackering our fridge/freezer and our DVD player.</p>\n<p>On our first evening in India our hosts took us out for a meal. We went to a place called the Kebab Factory. My stomach was still in a precarious state but when in Rome and all that. I could hardly go to India and not have an Indian meal. There are two choices on the menu at the Kebab Factory - Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian. Being a carnivore I chose none-veggie. The way it works is they bring you out a starter to try, and then another one, and then another one, and so on until you're about 20% past full, and then they start on the main courses. Pretty much everything was spicy, ranging from warm and tingly to Nuclear.</p>\n<p>It wasn't even my first curry of the day. When it came to Lunch at the office I was auditing, our hosts led us into a room where a chef had prepared a small curry banquet just for us.</p>\n<p>Normally I would love this. I do like a good curry but by this time I'd already had a good 4 days of running to the toilet. I ate it, I didn't want to offend our hosts after all, but with every mouth-full I was dreading the impending explosion in my bowels.</p>\n<p>The curries in India are not like the ones I used to eat in the UK. Some of the curry houses in Australia are a bit closer to the real thing. The main difference seems to be the sauces. They don't use so much of the thick gravy sauces like you get with the traditional British curry.</p>\n<p>On our second day in India (Tuesday) we had a day off due to it being Republic Day. Incidentally it was also Australia Day; a public holiday for pretty much the same reason (independence from the colonial masters).</p>\n<p>We was hoping that we might be able to make it into Delhi for the parades. We had no chance though. The security was really tight. We would have needed to have booked tickets week in advance. We couldn't get anywhere near the centre of Delhi due to the security. All the news channels and papers were speculating about the possibility of a terrorist attack.</p>\n<p>I watched some of the parades on TV. For the most part it was a parade of their Armed Forces. Much like the old Soviet Union and China, they like to parade their ballistic nuclear missiles down the road.</p>\n<p>Instead of going to the parade our driver took us to the Mall. When we got there it was pretty much empty, most people were probably still at home watching the parades. That soon changed in the afternoon. It was heaving!</p>\n<p>We did some shopping and had some lunch. The malls in Manila and India are just as good as you get in any western country, but the prices are amazing. It just goes to show how cheap they can make the goods for and how much markup we have to pay in Australia.</p>\n<p>When we left the mall a few hours later we expected we'd have to ring our driver to come and pick us up. We had him mobile number. But no, when we exited the mall we found that he was still sat there patiently waiting for us. He'd been there all the time. Poor sod. It was great having our own driver the whole time we were there so we made sure we gave him a good tip at the end of the stay.</p>\n<p>The hospitality we received in India was faultless. Both the company and the hotel we stayed in even went as far as giving us gift-wrapped gifts when we left.</p>\n<p>In the end, the India visit also seemed to be a bit of a waste of time as well. As I discovered, the only reason they are in scope is because they have the ability to access a table in a database which contains card numbers. They have no reason whatsoever to access that table. Once my client sorts out the table by rendering the card numbers unreadable (e.g. encryption or truncation) as they must do to be PCI compliant, and then remove access to the table, then the Indian company will not need to be audited.</p>\n<p>The flight back from India was quite a trip. To save a bit of money my client had us returning via Dubai and then Singapore with Emirates, rather than going straight back via Singapore with Singapore Airlines, who we flew with on our outbound trip. All in all the travelling time was 24 hours (with a 4 hour stop in Dubai and 2 hours in Singapore). To make it worse it was a night flight from India to Dubai so we'd already been up all day. By the time I got home we'd been up for 48 hours and i'd spent most of the journey burning up and feeling like shit. I was worried that when we got to Brissie they might have the SARS scanners in place looking for people with fevers and I might get quarantined. In my own town!</p>\n<p>It looks like I may be going back to Manila again quite soon. I don't think I'll need to go back to New Delhi. I loved Manila and Singapore but New Delhi was probably not the best introduction to India. The people are lovely but I'm not sure I'd want to holiday there. Saying that we didn't really get too see that much of the city. We didn't even see any of the final preparations for the Commonwealth Games.</p>\n<p>That two weeks was the longest I've ever spent away from Rach and Lauren. I love traveling and I'm grateful for the opportunities that my job brings. But it is nice to get home again.</p>\n<p>More trip photo's on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/sets/72157623376703510/\">Flickr</a> (I've made the pics Public so no need to log in).</p>\n",

It has won the Sydney to Hobart race four times and circumnavigated the world 3 times. Also, it was the first sailing boat to circumnavigate Australia since Matthew Flinders did it back in 1802.</div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<p>It was an early start when we slipped out into Moreton Bay on our way out to Moreton Island. It dawned on me that this was actually the first time I'd been out on a boat in Moreton Bay, besides catching the ferry over to Stradbroke Island. I never realised how many Island there are just a short sail away from Brisbane.</p>\n<p>We sailed past St Helena Island and Green Island, spotting numerous Dolphins on the way and made our way over to Tangalooma on the protected west side of Moreton Island.</p>\n<p>Once a Whaling Station, Tangalooma is now best known for it's Wild Dolphin Resort where you can stay at the hotel and then hand-feed the bottlenose dolphins which swim right up to the beach in the shallow waters during Sunset.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/4121109561\" title=\"View 'IMG_0860' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2582/4121109561_99e0da8140_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0860\" style=\"margin-right:10px;\" align=\"left\" /></a>Tangalooma is also known for its Wrecks Dive site, which was where we were heading.  Fifteen vessels, many of which were used to dredge the Brisbane River, have been deliberately sunk on the landward side of Moreton Island by the Brisbane Council to form a breakwall for small boats and a wreck dive and snorkel site. The Tangalooma Wrecks provide diving in depths from 2-10m and attract an amazing amount of marine life. Much of the wrecks is now covered in coral and the amount of tropical fish was very similar to when I went diving on the Barrier Reef.</div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\">\nThis time though I wasn't diving, just snorkelling.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as I jumped from the boat into the water I somehow managed to lose my snorkel. So for the first 20 minutes in the water I had to swim around in the water with only a face mask and no snorkel. I'm no free-diver so this became quite exhausting trying to hold my breath for long periods so I could get the snorkelling experience.  Luckily some of the other passengers became tired quite quickly and went back to the boat so I managed to get one of their snorkels.</p>\n<p>The experience was pretty amazing and I'll definitely be going out there again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/4123390017\" title=\"View 'IMG_0869' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2685/4123390017_552a7e9726_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0869\" style=\"margin-right:10px;\" align=\"left\" /></a> After snorkelling the next stop was to go sand-boarding. By this time however the weather had turned and it started to rain. I new straight away that the sand-boarding would be out of the window as you can't slide on wet sand. So we sailed around for a bit and waiting for the weather to brighten up again. It didn't take long and within the hour the sun was shining and with the heat what it was we new it wouldn't take long to dry out the sand.</p>\n<p>I've never been sand-boarding before. The picture to the right shows the sand cliff that we were to sand-board down. It's hard to get the right perspective in this photo, but trust me, it's high, and steep. The thing about sand-boarding of course, unlike when you go snow-boarding, is there's no ski-lifts to take you up to the top. To get to the top we simply had to climb, in the soft sand, in the searing heat. </p>\n<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say that the climb to the top was probably the most strenuous exercise I've had in years, in-fact, I think running the rock race up the Rock of Gibraltar was easier than that.</p>\n<p>Now I've never been snow-boarding either so standing on a sand-board, which looked just like a snow-board, was a completely new experience for me. None of the boat crew could be bothered to climb up there and from the forty or so passengers on the boat only a handful of us tried it out. So I had no-one to show me what to do. But how hard can it be right? You just stand on a board and try not to fall off!</p>\n<p>It took a few attempts to get my balance at the top and stay upright, and then once I was stable I pushed off. The idea is that you put the weight on your back foot to control the descent - the harder you dig in the slower you will go. That's the theory anyway. The truth is, as I quickly discovered, once the board picks up some speed it doesn't matter how hard you dig in, there's no stopping that momentum.</p>\n<p>I'm quite proud to say I managed to make it about three quarters of the way down before I fell off.</p>\n<p>I would have loved to have made it up for a second go but there was no way I was going to make that climb again. My calves were on fire!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/4123394905\" title=\"View 'IMG_0872' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2610/4123394905_e43578e849_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0872\" style=\"margin-right:10px;\" align=\"left\" /></a> After sand-boarding, the speedboat took us back to the Yacht where we had a beautiful lunch before having a leisurely sail around the islands.</p>\n<p>To end the the day I sat back, cracked open a bottle of beer and did a spot of sunbathing while we slowly made out way back to shore.</p>\n<p>A good day was had by all!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>We've recently returned from a memorable week on the Fraser Coast which included Whale Watching, a day on the world heritage listed Fraser Island and a trip to historic Maryborough.\n<h3>Whale Watching</h3>\n<p>The highlight of the week was definitely our trip out into Hervey Bay itself to see the Humpback Whales.</p>\n<p>Each winter, humpback whales migrate from Antarctic waters to the warm waters of South East Queensland to pop out their calves. The whales start to arrive around late July and many stay until November before their return to the Southern Ocean. Hervey Bay in particular, nestled and protected between the mainland and Fraser Island, offers calm, tropical waters for the Whales to introduce their calves to ocean life.</p>\n<p>The Whale Watching tours guarantee sightings between July and November so we had high hopes. We weren't disappointed.</p>\n<div style=\"float:left;\"><a title=\"View 'IMG_2500' on Flickr.com\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3948606545\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3483/3948606545_a40b46a442_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2500\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>Altogether we must have spotted at least 20 whales. They were everywhere. They happily came right up to the boat and even swam underneath us.<br><br>We saw multiple breaches, as well as chasing and rolling. It truly was breathtaking.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:10px;float:left;\"><a title=\"View 'IMG_2534' on Flickr.com\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3949396984\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2493/3949396984_f69a20a96f_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2534\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>If you live in Brisbane and want to go Whale Watching I definitely recommend making the 4 hour trip north to Hervey Bay rather than taking one of the tours from the Gold Coast or Redcliffe. A friend of Rachelle's went on one of the trips from the Gold Coast and all she saw was one tail from about 5 miles away.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:10px;float:left;\"><a title=\"View 'IMG_2583' on Flickr.com\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3949403536\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2606/3949403536_742a835b81_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2583\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>At one point they stuck an Hydrophone into the water so we could clearly here the whales singing. However when the whales were next to the boat and underneath us we didn't need the Hydrophone. The sound emanating from beneath us was magical.\n<a href=\"https://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/3ab7b-14_09_09-4_03-pm1.mp3\">Whale singing recorded from my iphone</a>\n<br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<h3>Fraser Island</h3>\n<p>Fraser Island is the world's largest sand island, stretching over 123 km in length and 22km at its widest point, and is the only place in the world where you can find sub-tropical rainforests growing out of the sand. Fraser Island marks the southern barrier of the Great Barrier Reef.</p>\n<p>We went on a day trip to Fraser Island with an organised tour. You can travel there yourself but Fraser Island is strictly 4x4 vehicles only. As soon as we arrived there in our big high-suspension 4x4 tour bus I realised why. Our car wouldn't have made it 5 metres off the jetty! There are no roads, only tracks, and rough tracks at that.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3949419026\" title=\"View 'Python' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3534/3949419026_6055c76db3_m.jpg\" alt=\"Python\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>We started our tour by stopping off in the middle of the rainforest to check out the wide variety of plants and trees - many of them centuries old. Thankfully, now that the Island is world-heritage listed, the widespread logging that took place, particularly for the famously tough Fraser Island Satinay, has been severely limited. </p>\n<p>It wasn't long before we came across a python lurking at the base of a tree.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\">\nWe then made our way on to Seventy-Five Mile Beach, which as the name suggests, is a very long beach. It's also a very beautiful beach - a wide stretch of unspoilt white sand.</p>\n<p>We had a paddle in Eli Creek which is the largest freshwater stream on the eastern coast of the island. The water gently flows downhill and spills out on to the beach which means you can lay on your back and float down it.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5px;float:left;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3948649153\" title=\"View 'IMG_2720' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2440/3948649153_ee09d7d076_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2720\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>To get another perspective of the island we opted to pay extra and take a 15 minute flight over the island. It was one of those 8-seater peddle and pop jobs where a slight gust of wind feels like it will blow you out of the sky. All good fun! </p>\n<p>From the air you really get to see the breadth and beauty of the island.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5px;float:left;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3949435940\" title=\"View 'IMG_2738' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2672/3949435940_0fc586106a_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2738\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>The island has over 100 freshwater lakes and some huge multi-coloured sand blows - towering cliffs of sand sculptured by the wind into huge peaks.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5px;float:left;\"><a title=\"View 'IMG_2748' on Flickr.com\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3948657173\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2425/3948657173_8cbab1ae90_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2748\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>This picture shows our view of the shipwreck of the SS Maheno which was forced to run aground during a cyclone in 1935.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5px;float:left;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3948666189\" title=\"View 'IMG_2776' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2513/3948666189_4a00b7f995_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2776\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>Here's the view of the wreck when back on terra firma; the saltwater slowly but surely eating away at the hull.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5px;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3948672729\" title=\"View 'IMG_2797' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2422/3948672729_80402539ca_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2797\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>After lunch we made our way up to Lake McKenzie for a swim. This is probably about as close to paradise as you could ever come, or it would be if you could get rid of all the other people.  This huge freshwater perched lake has crystal clear water and is completely surrounded by pristine white sandy beaches. The water has a ph level of 4.5 which is about the same as your skin. After swimming in the lake my hair felt like it had just been conditioned. They should bottle the stuff! It was close to idyllic but not quite; only let down by the large group of lads who by the sounds of it thought they were on San Antonio beach in Ibiza.  They should be banned! God, I do sound old!</p>\n<p>The only thing we didn't see on Fraser Island was any Dingoes. Not surprising really when you consider that there's only about 150 of them left on the island. The Queensland government issue plenty of awareness info and signs to be Dingo safe when camping on the island. The last major incident was in April 2001 when a young boy was attacked and killed. Following that 30 of the dingoes were destroyed.</p>\n<h3>Maryborough</h3>\n<p>The rest of the week was mainly spent relaxing by the pool, catching up on reading, watching DVD's, eating and drinking too much - the usual stuff. It was our first real holiday in quite a while and we were more than ready for a break. On the final day though we decided to have a drive out to Maryborough.</p>\n<p>The literature says that Maryborough is a complete visitor experience like no other. For us it was a visitor experience like no other because when we got there it was completely deserted. We couldn't believe it. It was a Saturday afternoon and there was hardly anybody around.</p>\n<p>Maryborough was settled in 1847 and is one of Queensland's oldies provincial cities. Except you can't really call it a city any more, can you? The place was thriving in its day, so we learned. </p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5px;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3949476778\" title=\"View 'IMG_2866' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2637/3949476778_d794e85be2_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2866\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>Back in the day, Maryborough was a major port and second only to Sydney in terms of the intake of european immigrants (convicts). The port is now long gone. The end of major logging on Fraser Island was the final nail in the coffin for Maryborough so they've now turned it into a beautiful historic preservation, showcasing the architecture of its colonial past. The fact that nobody was there seemed to add to the charm. Standing on Wharf St - the main street where every building is a listed, beautifully preserved heritage building, it felt like a scene from a Western. I half expected to see tumbleweed blow across the square.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<p>We had a pleasant enough day though. We had a look round the Military museum which is a lovingly maintained collection of war memorabilia, including an impressive Victoria Cross collection. Lauren in particular enjoyed seeing the exhibits which surprised me as I hated museums when I was a kid. I'm pretty sure she's going to turn into a geek like her father.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5px;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3948709133\" title=\"View 'IMG_2915' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2578/3948709133_c3f895c6d6_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2915\" style=\"margin:0 15px 10px 0;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>We had a nice lunch by the Mary river and then went on a river cruise to see the sights. Not that there were many to be seen to be honest. Mainly spots where things used to exist when Maryborough was a bustling port. There were some pretty impressive river-side homes to behold, and our skipper's commentary (he was from Belfast) kept us entertained, being both informative and funny.<br><br>If you look very closely in the picture to the left you can just about see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>We also spent some time in the park, which looked beautiful on this gloriously hot and sunny afternoon.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:5px;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3948718157\" title=\"View 'IMG_2946' on Flickr.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2461/3948718157_a8890025d2_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2946\" style=\"margin-right:15px;\" align=\"left\" /></a></div>\n<p>Mary Poppins' author P.L Travers was born in Maryborough in 1899 and a life-sized bronze statue of her famous creation can be found around the corner from Wharf St in Richmond St.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<p>The only minor disappointed of our holiday was where we stayed. Not the accommodation, just the location. We had originally booked into the Ramada Resort which had fantastic deals on for its opening month. However when it came to it the Hotel wasn't yet ready to be opened so we took their offer of a transfer to the Quarterdecks Harbour Retreat. When we arrived we were really pleased that we'd been upgraded to a 3-bedroom Villa, which had all the mod-cons, designer furniture, the lot. The only problem was the location. It's quite a distance from the beach and marina. It's easily walkable during the day, but at night with very dim street lighting (what is it about inadequate street lighting in Australia?) and no proper pavements I wouldn't have felt comfortable having Rach and Lauren walk along those streets. So to go out at night it was either one of us drove or we got a taxi. Besides that Hervey Bay itself leaves a lot to be desired. I was hoping it was going to be like Mooloolaba with al-fresco dining along the ocean front, but no, it was more like Skegness with tacky stores and fish and chip shops. The northern end isn't so bad. We had a lovely meal in the Wheelhouse Restaurant which overlooks the marina.</p>\n<p>All in all it was a fantastic week, and we'll definitely be returning that way in the future. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/sets/72157622442919454/\">You can check out many more of our Hervey Bay holiday photo's on Flickr</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Continuing with the wedding planning, on the 13th April we went away for the weekend (well, just one night actually) as we had a decision to make.  After setting the date we wanted to get the invites out in the post as soon as possible so we could give friends and family in the UK plenty of notice.\nWe had already decided that we would only want a small civil ceremony - basically a prelude to a piss up, and we'd also want to do something a little bit different.  We looked at plenty of options and there were two options that we liked the look of.  The first option was to have a wedding up in the mountains.  The second option was a river cruise, where we would have the ceremony and a party on board the river boat.</p>\n<p>So on the Saturday in question we went up to Mooloolaba to check out the River Cruise and then we went and spent one night in the <a href=\"http://www.treehouses.com.au/\">Treetop Houses of Montville</a> in the Glasshouse Mountains.</p>\n<p>We ended up being really impressed with both. The river cruise looks to be just the right size for the small gathering that we want, and cruising through the Mooloolaba canal system at sunset definitely has a romantic ring to it. The menu options also look fabulous and apparently the seafood buffet is award-winning.  Whereas the Treetop Houses is somewhere we'd definitely recommend for a romantic getaway.</p>\n<p>After checking out the river boat in the afternoon, we made our way up to the Treetop Houses.  We had booked to stay one night in a Treehouse, and yes, they are actually houses on stilts up in the trees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73083589@N00/3624661936\" title=\"View 'IMG_0507' on Flickr.com\">\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3649/3624661936_027a31666f_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0507\" /></div>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>This was our version of camping - it had 2 bedrooms and a lounge with a large tv and wood fire! We did have a few problems with the fire though. It's been quite a long time since I've made a fire and in an attempt to get it going we ended up smoking the house out. We ended up having to have the door and windows open for hours to clear the smoke and stench, which kind of defeated the purpose of having the fire (by that time it had started getting cold in the evenings).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/e1BKp7AaQzt2eN_KWV3uu6Bjk1g_OOA_A04hbkGZCfw?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g8N188CcT-A/TjzDenNswWI/AAAAAAAACFI/Hvn5iKf0GKY/s400/photo%252812%2529.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<p>In the evening we tried out their restaurant.  The quality of the restaurant was really important to us because, if chosen, they would be catering our wedding.</p>\n<p>They didn't disappoint. The food was fantastic - one of the best meals I've had since arriving in Australia.</p>\n<p>After the meal we went back to the treehouse to snuggle up by the fire and before long, a possum appeared sniffing up against the door.  Lauren went right up to it and it wasn't scared at all - it must be used to getting scraps of food from the guests.</p>\n<p>The next morning we had a good look around the site and found a few picturesque spots which would make a good location for the ceremony. </p>\n<p>So, we had a decision to make. We talked it through and agreed that both options would be fantastic, but the river cruise is the one we've settled on. Getting married up in the mountains near Kondililla Falls would certainly be romantic, but we want the main theme of our wedding, if there is a theme, to be fun, and simply put, we reckon it will be more fun on the boat!</p>\n<p>The boat only fits about 30 guests so it really is going to be close friends and family.

				"content_text": "<p>Why is it that the word 'Wedding' automatically adds $$$ to the cost of things?\nThis weekend we went up to Noosa for a wedding fayre.¬† Yes, you would be right in thinking that attending a wedding fayre is is not in my top 5 things to do on a Sunday.¬† However, sensing that I would immediately come up with some convenient excuse not to go, Rachelle offered a suitable bribe - she would pay for us to stay the night before at the hotel where it was being held.¬† I didn't know anything about this hotel, except that it's called the Noosa Springs Golf Resort and Spa.¬† Sounded good to me!</p>\n<p>We drove up there Saturday afternoon in torrential rain, in our car which is now missing the front registration plate after some thieving rascal had taken it whilst it was parked outside a RSL club the night before.¬† It's an offence to drive around without it but there was no way we were going to go through the rigmarole Saturday morning of getting it replaced, which involves getting a police crime number and then going to Queensland Transport to arrange for a new one and hoping we can simply get a replacement without having to re-register the car with a completely new rego (we're still sorting this out so as of writing I don't know the answer to this).</p>\n<p>Anyway... we somehow managed to make it up there without getting stopped by the police or being swept away in the rain.¬† We didn't really have any plans for when we got there, except that we wanted to go for a nice meal Saturday night to celebrate the fact that it was the¬†2 year anniversary of our arrival in Australia.¬† Given the weather, and the fact that the hotel restaurant has good reviews from what I could tell, we expected to eat there.¬† However, on arriving we were told that the restaurant wasn't open that night due to the Wedding Fayre the following day.¬† How ridiculous.¬† So our choice was to go out, or order a takeaway, except, unlike most resorts of this kind with individual apartments, there were no takeaway menus in the room.</p>\n<p>We braved the weather conditions and went out.¬† Our first choice was to go to an Italian we had been to before and really enjoyed on our first trip to Australia.¬† I can't remember what it was called but it was in Sunshine Beach.¬† I say 'was' because when we got there we discovered it was no longer there.¬† We then drove to Hastings St in Noosa, the famous street in Noosa where most tourists head to for restaurants and boutique shops.¬† Unfortunately when we got there it was hammering it down even more, we couldn't get parked up outside a restaurant and because we hadn't brought any brollies there was no way I was going to get Rach and Lauren to run from the car park to the nearest restaurant.</p>\n<p>We gave up and ended up going for a KFC followed by the movies where we watched Night at the Museum 2.¬† Wasn't quite the evening we had planned but we enjoyed it nonetheless.¬† Night at the Museum 2 was good family fun and you can't go far wrong with a belly full of the colonel's chicken!</p>\n<p>As for the wedding fayre, it wasn't that bad as these things go.¬† There was plenty of champagne and wedding cake to try.¬† And I experienced my first ever catwalk fashion show.¬† I must admit though that I did blush a little when the models came out in skimpy lingerie (at which point Lauren attempted to cover my eyes).¬† I wasn't expecting that, I thought it would just be the wedding gowns.</p>\n<p>The problem with these wedding fayres of course is that it gives the bride-to-be ideas.¬† I don't think my idea of getting married at a public BBQ area and asking everyone to bring a bottle and some snags is going to wash anymore!¬† I was walking around the vendors displaying their wares at the wedding fayre and all the time I was thinking 'HOW MUCH?'.¬† I really begrudge paying that much for 100 photographs and DVD when I reckon I could get copies of the guest's photo's and knock up something decent in Photoshop and iMovie.¬† Similarly, why pay stupid amounts of money for a wedding cake when I can go to Dunkin' Donuts and buy a load of donuts and arrange them in some kind of fancy tower?</p>\n<p>One of the first stands we visited was displaying wedding jewelery, attended by a man and a woman.¬† While the woman was showing Rachelle the jewellery, the guy gave me a handy little card with a checklist of items that I should remember to purchase Rach for her special day.¬† How thoughtful.¬† The list read as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pair of diamond stups &amp; hoops - simple and classic</li>\n<li>Diamond ring - forever in style</li>\n<li>Pearl necklace - stylish and elegant</li>\n<li>Pearl earrings - to match of course</li>\n<li>Dress ring - for that special occasion</li>\n<li>Gold bangle - for everyday style</li>\n<li>Gold chain - from day to evening</li>\n<li>Gold bracelet - elegant adornment everyday</li>\n<li>Diamond &amp; gem stone pendant - touch of colour</li>\n<li>Dress watch - personal fashion statement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jesus christ!¬† I've told Rach that I'll commit to the wedding ring but she doesn't need the rest as I don't want to marry Mr T.¬† If lucky, she may get a pearl necklace on the honeymoon ;-) Sorry, have I gone too far?</p>\n<p>We somehow have to compromise between me preferring to spend money on the stag night and honeymoon, and the expense of the so-called dream wedding.¬† Luckily Rachelle has always been a 'cheap date' and with a good head on her shoulders she realises like me that it's stupid to spend $20,000 on one day (which I here is about average these days).¬† That's not to say it won't be good day. It will. It's just we may be making some cost savings here and there.¬† Another idea of mine is to have a nude wedding, that way we don't have to shell out for a wedding dress, bridesmaids dress or my suit.¬† Rachelle seems to think nobody wants to see that and some members of our family might not be keen.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Me and Rachelle have been together over 9 years now and engaged for quite a few of those.¬† We have a 7 year-old daughter, and most people just presume that we're already married.¬† Rachelle often gets called Mrs Haines and never bothers to correct them.\nShe's been nagging me for quite a while to agree to set a date, and I don't really know what's been stopping me.¬† I guess after having one previous failed marriage I was a bit disillusioned with the whole concept of marriage and thought it was unnecessary; after all, we're living together and have a kid, so what difference would marriage make?¬† Plus, there's always been other priorities.¬† Every year after we got engaged there seemed to be something that would take priority, such as moving house, starting a business, and most recently emigrating.</p>\n<p>We got talking this weekend about our next holiday, trying to decide whether to go on holiday somewhere this year, or save up and go back to the UK next year to visit friends and family.¬† It's then that it dawned on me that for the first time in a long time we're truly settled.¬† We're not thinking about moving house, or waiting to sell a house (as we were for 2 years in the UK), or waiting for a Visa, or uncertain about the next career path.¬† There's absolutely nothing stopping us from doing the dirty deed anymore!</p>\n<p>To be honest, even though it has been Rach who was previously pressing the most for us to set a date, this time it was completely my idea. She hasn't mentioned it in ages.¬† So when I suggested it (in my defence I had consumed a couple of glasses of wine) you could say she was rather pleased!</p>\n<p>So does that mean that I've changed my mind about marriage?¬† I suppose I have.¬† The most important thing is family, and even though marriage couldn't do anything to make us a closer family, at least it will mean we all share the same name.¬† And, it's a good excuse for a party!!</p>\n<p>So, November 2010 is the date that we've decided.¬† It's 18 months down the line so that friends and family from the UK can have a chance to save up and get out here.¬† Rach is now busy wedding planning - researching venues so that we can book and get a firm date.</p>\n<h3>Hyatt Regency Coolum</h3>\n<p>It was a relaxing mini-break at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Coolum on the Sunshine Coast that was the setting for us finally agreeing a date, courtosy of my employers.¬† My company holds an annual event where they get to take customers and our vendor partners away to a posh hotel for a couple of days, with the third day being for employees. Saturday night in the hotel was paid for.¬† So was dinner Saturday evening, including wine.¬† I'm glad to say that although I did indulge quite heavily in the free wine, I have learnt my lesson from the time in Antwerp when I got alcoholic poisoning from free red wine (that's a whole other story), and managed to stay reasonably coherent.</p>\n<p>The days started with a couple of hours bonding in the morning, which mainly involved Exec and the account managers regaling us with their stories of drunkenness from the previous 2 nights.¬† Then the rest of the day was our own.¬† It was a nice family occasion.¬† We'd taken Lauren with us and many of my colleagues had also brought their kids.¬† The Hyatt Regency is a massive sprawling complex, with individual villas rather than your standard hotel with rooms, much like many of the all-inclusive resorts you get around the world.¬† There were shuttle buses and golf buggies to get around the place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hPAn-ULiPL6VXVGHOJKFS3HSisyphHRNiMFnLIsvhT4?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xpofBKFO3Io/TjzrIG7xeiI/AAAAAAAACIc/6zlyL5-F00k/s400/IMG_0439.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<p>The hotel itself is home to the Australian PGA Championship golf course and if we'd had more time I would have loved to have got in a game, but with only one afternoon there, and the fact that it costs $75 just for 9 holes, and I'd forgot to take my clubs so I would have had the cost of hiring clubs on top of that, I decided not to bother this time.¬† Instead we went down to the beach club, quickly went on the beach and saw that it was empty (with the exception of my boss, Tim, and his missus sitting there in their chairs looking like a typical English couple on a day out in Skegness (he's a fellow pom).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WBCmXnqh2lnnXRhNgX9fYXHSisyphHRNiMFnLIsvhT4?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VWgL8yFKy9k/TjzrZRMC3RI/AAAAAAAACI0/QnOBLA-6yE0/s400/IMG_2386.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<p>The sea was pretty rough with lots of dumpers so I neshed out on going in.¬† I did brave the beach-side pool though, only afterwords discovering that it was the one pool that isn't heated!¬† This time of year the water is freezing.¬† Both myself and Lauren went in but there's no getting Rach in an unheated pool when the outside temperature is anything under 30 degrees C!</p>\n<p>After lunch we went up to the Village Pool as it's know, which is much larger and, importantly, heated.¬† There's 9 pools in the hotel altogether apparently.</p>\n<p>We all gathered in the evening for drinks before proceeding for dinner in the hotel's Italian restaurant.¬† With it being nearly Winter the hotel was pretty quiet so we virtually took over the restaurant.</p>\n<p>For the first time in what must be a year, we had organised a babysitter to come to the room to look after Lauren.¬† Lauren was quite happy about it though, as when I first told her that we were going to the hotel her very first response was 'Has it got room service?'¬† From all the hotels we've stayed in over the years it seems the thing she gets most excited about is room service.</p>\n<p>Rach is still not completely comfortable with using babysitters that we don't know (which is why we don't get out very often on our own) and was a bit wary.¬† But we'd booked a professional babysitting company - <a href=\"http://www.nanniesofnoosa.com\">Nannies of Noosa</a> - and she was relieved when the women who turned up wasn't some 17 year old kid, but a lovely women who had brought a bag of games to play with Lauren.¬† Lauren really enjoyed it and we'd definitely recommend Nannies of Noosa.</p>\n<p>The Italian was fantastic.¬† As there was a large group of us it was a set menu rather than us all choosing our meals individually.¬† We had 3 different pasta dishes to choose from for the main course which was fine by me - Italian is probably my favourite cuisine.</p>\n<p>Come 10:30pm we went back to the room, which was the time we'd pre-agreed with the babysitter, however Rach nicely offered to continue babysitting duties while I went back out to rejoin my colleagues for a few more drinks.</p>\n<p>About 9 of us ended up in the hotel nightclub - Frasers.¬† We were the only ones in there!¬† That's probably why they closed the bar at 1am, much to my disappointment.¬† The bar closing was my trigger to go to bed.</p>\n<p>All in all it was a really good trip.¬† The Hyatt Regency is lovely, although a little bit dated.¬† The rooms are certainly in need of modernisation. But it wasn't costing us anything so we could have no complaints.¬† Even though the hotel, dinner and drinks with the meal were all paid for, we managed to rack up a $400 bill.¬† That's the danger of charging drinks to the room, it's far too easy.¬† A round of shots that I bought in the nightclub cost me $65, as I discovered the next morning.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Something is seriously wrong with my brain this week.¬† Two incidents give cause for concern that I may have Frank Spencer syndrome:\n<strong>Incident 1</strong> - over the weekend Rach asked me to have a look at the car because it wouldn't start.¬† I got in it, turned the key and I got absolutely nothing from the engine. Totally dead.¬† The lights were working and so was the radio, so no problems with the battery.¬† The engine just wouldn't turn over.¬† So after looking through the manual and under the hood, trying to kid myself that I know something about cars, I rang RACQ.</p>\n<p>The RACQ man arrived within about 20 minutes.¬† He opened the driver door, had a look inside, then turned to me and said 'can you try starting the car again please'.¬† So I got in and again tried to start the car.¬† After it wouldn't start I looked at him and noticed that he had a mocking smirk on his face and was looking at the gear stick.¬† It's then that it dawned on me...</p>\n<p>The last time I drove the car I must have switched the engine off while it was still in Drive, not Parked as you should with automatics.¬† The engine won't start in automatics if you're already in Drive - a quite sensible safety feature, as if you haven't got your foot on the brake you will drive into your garage wall!</p>\n<p>Such a schoolboy error.¬† In my defence this is my first automatic car but even so, it was rather embarrassing.¬† Luckily the RACQ man didn't give me too much stick.¬† He said it was quite a common occurance (not sure if he was humouring me or not) and was happy because he was hoping this would be an easy call-out.</p>\n<p>Rach never noticed it was in Drive either so there's two dullards in our house.</p>\n<p><strong>Incident 2 </strong>- today I'm in North Sydney doing a security audit for a customer.¬† As part of the audit I went out to their highly secure data centre to do a physical security inspection.¬† The building is one of those unmarked, CCTV cameras everywhere buildings that big companies and government agencies use to host their servers.¬† On completion of the inspection I inadvertantly managed to set off the bulding intruder alarm.</p>\n<p>To exit, badge holders have to use the mantraps with fingerprint recognition and card reader authentication, whereas visitors can just press a button and wait to be let out.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I pressed the button, waited a few seconds, but nothing happened.¬† I then pressed the button again, thought I heard a click and then proceeded to open the door.¬† As soon as I did an ear-piercing alarm went off throughout the building, and I nearly shat myself!¬† The security guards came running towards me and quickly realised that they were dealing with an idiot.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, I'd completely missed the large sign on the door which states 'WAIT UNTIL THE LIGHT TURNS FROM RED TO GREEN BEFORE OPENING THIS DOOR'.¬† I'd somehow not noticed the sign, or the lights.</p>\n<p>I think I need more sleep.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I've just been going through some old papers I've kept, ready to scan them with my flash new scanner/printer/copier thingymajiggy so I can have a paperless office, and I've come across my best man's speech that I gave.\nApologies to Mark and Katherine in advance if you read this and have to re-live it.¬† I'm cringing reading it now, nearly 10 years later, but for posterity's sake here it is:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls.¬† For all of you who don‚Äôt know me my name is Daryl Would-you-like-another-drink. Long name I know but please do not be afraid to say hello to me today.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">I‚Äôve been given the honour of being the best man.¬† I'm only going to speak for a couple of minutes because of my throat‚Ä¶ if I say anything insulting Katherine has threatened to cut it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Actually it is a great honour to be asked to be best man, as well as terrifying. Being asked to be the best man is a bit like being asked to make love to the queen mum; it‚Äôs a great honour but nobody really wants to do it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Right, before I carry on with Mark‚Äôs character assassination, I would like to thank the Brides Maids for performing their role wonderfully and looking so beautiful throughout the day. I must say it has been a wonderful day and a very emotional wedding. Even the cake is in tiers! Did I write this?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">I'm sure I also speak for the happy couple, when I sincerely thank you all for eating and drinking your way through ¬£10,000 of their money, condemning their early years of wedded bliss to poverty, hardship, destitution, and debt.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">With regards to myself, I think that my duties as Best Man to get Mark here ON TIME, which is a first; SOBER, which is unusual; AND SMART, which is unheard of have been successful!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">I‚Äôve known Mark near enough all of my life.¬† When we were kids we lived on the same street and we were rarely apart.¬† In fact my mum started claiming child benefit for him. Well she had to recoup the money she spent on cleaning the carpet he puked on .¬† Even when I left home I couldn‚Äôt get away from him, as he and Katherine moved onto the same street as me when they bought their own house. This I‚Äôm sure Katherine now regrets.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">I can‚Äôt remember much about what we got up to as kids but I think it‚Äôs fair to say our teenage years were quite eventful.¬† I can remember being 14 years old, Mark was 15 or 16, we were full of hormones, energy and a highly developed interest in girls, that‚Äôs when we started going to disco‚Äôs.¬†¬† Bedazzled by bright lights, loud music and more girls that any adolescent schoolboy can comprehend, we hit the dance floor. This was where I was to witness the raw, and still undiscovered talent of Mark‚Äôs rhythm. Regularly he would empty the dance floor with his dance moves, which would leave all the ladies speechless. So speechless in fact that they never spoke to him.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Being such good friends and not wanting to leave each others side we kind of had a pact.¬† Invariably whenever one of us went on a date, the other one would end up with the girl‚Äôs best friend.¬† So Mark, I‚Äôd like to apologise because when it was my turn and I set you up on those blind dates, I knew very well they were pig ugly, it‚Äôs just that look on your face when you were introduced was magic it still has me laughing now whenever I think of it.¬† I noticed you never complained much though. I‚Äôm just glad to see your taste has improved.¬† I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll all agree with me that Katherine looks stunning today and I can see Mark is beaming with pride.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Anyway I'd like to tell you about all of the mammoth drinking binges we‚Äôve been on. I'd like to tell you about the sordid events that went on during our nights out together. In fact I'd like someone to tell me because I just can't remember - something about beer amnesia or something‚Ä¶I can't remember.¬† One thing that Mark is certainly renowned for is his regular inability to go through a night out without throwing up. I think it 's safe to mention this now as you've all finished your meals. There have been numerous occasions down the years when he has managed to lay his own personal pavement pizza on the streets and in the clubs.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Another thing you ought to know about Mark is his amazing memory.¬† Regularly he reminds me of things we got up to when we were younger.¬† Embarrassing things that I‚Äôd completely forgot about.¬† But please Mark‚Ä¶ stop it.¬† I‚Äôve forgotten these things for a reason.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Mark‚Äôs a good friend. He‚Äôs always been there when I needed him. When I was in the Navy, whenever I came home off deployment he was always there to drag me out on the town and catch up on all the gossip. And when I‚Äôve been down he‚Äôs always managed to cheer me up. The best example has got to be when I failed my driving test. I was absolutely gutted and scared of telling him in case he took the mick. You see for some reason I had it in my head that he passed his first time. Anyway he rang me up and asked me how I got on, I said I failed and he said ‚Äòwell don‚Äôt worry I failed mine first time also‚Äô. I said ‚Äòoh yeah what did you fail on‚Äô and I‚Äôll never forget his reply. The examiner told him to park up at a safe place by the side of the road, so where did he park? Right outside the Fire Station blocking their exit path. Well I nearly wet myself. Then he said ‚ÄòOh and Katherine failed hers first time as well‚Äô I said ‚Äòoh yeah what did she do‚Äô he said ‚Äòwell she kind of hit a parked car‚Äô. Well that was hit I was in tears. I‚Äôm sorry to say they are both now legally driving so if you see them on the road, keep a safe distance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Well I suppose you‚Äôd like to hear about the Stag night. Mark, have you told Katherine the full story? I hope you have for your sake or this is going to be the shortest marriage in history. Here goes, well all day he was determined that nothing was going to happen to him and he wouldn‚Äôt get in too much of a state. In fact he moaned that much that we just about gave up hope of doing anything to him. The strange thing is though that what did happen to him was near enough all of his own making. O.K I set it up ..but he wasn‚Äôt complaining. We went in one pub and I heard the D.J reading out Birthday requests e.t.c so I thought I‚Äôll see if I can get him a mention. So I went up and told the D.J that Mark from Worksop was here on his stag night, and he said ‚Äòoh I‚Äôm from Tickhill (which is only a few miles from here) I‚Äôll have your mate put on a show. I said ok not really knowing what he meant. Anyway a few minutes later this was it. The D.J announced ‚Äòcan we have Mark from Worksop in front of the D.J. box please‚Äô I looked at Mark and I could see the fear in his face. Well I‚Äôm sure you can guess what happened next. The D.J. got some girls to form a ring around him and the deal was if they could get his pants off and take them to the D.J they and Mark would win a bottle of champagne. Well at this point I honestly expected Mark to be out of the pub like a shot. But no, not only did he stay put he actually got into the swing of things. Suddenly he turned into Mr Chippendale and was right giving it some. However, there was one slight difference in the ending. Never mind Mark, it was quite cold in there.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Well here he is on his big day.¬† I can't imagine how Mark feels today, how does the first day of the rest of your life manifest itself for a man who's experience of reality is that unpleasant pause while the Playstation loads the next game? The lads here know what I‚Äôm talking about.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">We may be asking ourselves what Katherine sees in Mark, I regularly do as well. But they do say love is blind but marriage is definitely an eye-opener. So I'd just like to say Mark, you are a lucky groom marrying Katherine today. She deserves a good husband. So thank goodness you married her before she found one.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Well that brings me to the end of my speech and it gives me immense pleasure to invite you all to stand and raise your glasses in a toast to Mark and Katherine - because I think that they were made for each other: May your love be modern enough to survive the times, and old fashioned enough to last forever. To the Bride and Groom's Future Happiness.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>So we've moved house, and I'd forgot how much of a nightmare it is.¬† We certainly won't be doing it again in a hurry.\nWe've been in Brisbane nearly 2 years now and the place we were renting was ok as our first little settler home, but it was a bit cramped and we were desperate for more storage.¬† We had boxes of books that we had shipped over with us that remained unopened in the garage because we had nowhere to put them.</p>\n<p>We had been thinking about moving for a while, and then we had a little incident with one of our neighbours which quickly helped make up our minds that it was time to move on.</p>\n<p>Anyway we're still renting, for a number of reasons.¬† For one we haven't got the deposit for a house and the days of 100% mortgages are well gone.¬† Plus, we're still getting to know the area and haven't fully decided where we want to settle.¬† Furthermore I don't think it's the right time to buy at the moment with the market the way it is - there's still a possibility of house prices dropping, and renting is just so much less hassle.¬† We don't have to pay council tax or water rates (yes I know we pay it indirectly through the rent).¬† Any problems with the house and we just ring the landlord, and we pay $5 a week for the front and back gardens to be taken care of.¬† It's all to easy!</p>\n<p>I wish I could say the same about moving.¬† I forgot what a major project it is.¬† We've only moved 7km away but emigrating across the world seemed less hard work!</p>\n<p>We moved in on the 4th April and it's took pretty much the last 3 weeks to get unpacked, settled and everything as we want it.¬† It's still a 3 bedroom house but there's a lot more space, and it's got a double garage which makes a huge difference.¬† We ended up making a couple of trips to IKEA for some new furniture.¬† The second of those trips was to take back some furniture from the first trip, which, when we got it home and opened, we discovered that it was in Beach and not white like the rest of it.¬† Not sure whether we screwed up or IKEA.¬† Nonetheless we'd had it delivered because we couldn't fit it in the car and we had to somehow get it back and replaced.¬† We rang IKEA who referred us to the delivery company, who in turn told us that they'd have to charge us for two journeys.¬† We ended up hiring a transit van from Europcar for the day which turned out to be much cheaper than IKEA charge just for one delivery.¬† Something we'll definitely bear in mind for the future.</p>\n<p>We love our new house and the location.¬† It's closer to work for Rach, now just over 3km to Moreton Bay, and although it's further away from the city for me, I can now easily get a train into work which is much better than getting the bus.¬† We've had to move Lauren to a new school which is not something we really wanted to do but she's been very good about it.¬† It helps that her new school has got its own swimming pool.</p>\n<p>A few pics...</p>\n<div>\n<dl id=\"attachment_379\" style=\"width:310px;\"> <img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fef17fc4cf.jpg\" alt=\"New Home\" title=\"New Home\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-379\" /> </dl>\n</div>\n<p>It's only a year old so everything's still new and shiny!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/3461688703/\" title=\"Untitled by darylhai, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3569/3461688703_0b94bd0633.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Putting together our Entertainment unit wasn't easy as we are not allowed to fix anything to the walls.¬† We ended up having to drill holes through the unit, buy a length of steel screw rod and hacksaw some off to screw into the holes in the back of the tele, and then push it through the wood and secure with wing nuts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/3462141852/\" title=\"Finally a home for our books by darylhai, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3499/3462141852_ee5c5b5161.jpg\" alt=\"Finally a home for our books\"></a></p>\n<p>Finally our books are out.¬† Some of them anyway.¬† I've still got a pile that's still waiting for a home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/3461937135/\" title=\"IMG_0422 by darylhai, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3518/3461937135_f1d25f5637.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0422\"></a></p>\n<p>Use of a pool was a must.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/3461681157/\" title=\"Untitled by darylhai, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3550/3461681157_fabfe38704.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Only a small backyard but it's got a covered entertaining area for our barbies!</p>\n<p>It's a quiet area and we're surrounded by plenty of parkland.</p>\n<p>The only downside, and it's a pretty big downside for me, is that I can't yet get ADSL.¬† I've had the same problem I had as when I moved into the previous place where I've discovered that there's no spare capacity on the sub-exchange that feeds this area.¬† I've basically got to keep re-applying until I can get in.¬† In the meantime I'm on wireless broadband but the signal quality is pretty crap in this area (I'm currently with Virgin who use the Optus network).¬† I may have to bite the bullet and go with Telstra Next-G even though they're expensive, their customer service is crap, and I hate them as a company for using their monopoly to stifle the growth of broadband, much like BT in the UK.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On Thursday I held my monthly Brisbane Internet Business Meetup Group which I organise through <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com\">meetup.com</a>.¬† I've unbelievably now got 129 members.¬† After holding the first few meetups at a Coffee Club, I sent a survey out to all members asking if they wanted to continue with the current informal format, change to a more formal setting where people can give presentations, or do a combination of the both.¬† The feedback was clearly on the side of a combination of both.\nLuckily, one of the members runs a government-sponsored company that supports startups and offered me the use of his conference room to hold the meetups.¬† It's roughly a 30-seat room with internet connection and projector so perfect for our needs, and he also arranges free drinks and nibbles for us all.</p>\n<p>It's working out pretty well.¬† When I schedule each event I issue a call-out for volunteers to give presentations.¬† Due to the size of the room, and with us having 129 members, I set an attendance limit of 30, however meetup.com has a great system which, once the R.S.V.P limit has been reached, allows members to be added to a waiting list which automatically adds them if anyone drops out.¬† Shortly before the meetup, once I've got an idea of who's presenting I send out a rough agenda to all those that have R.S.V.P'd.¬† The agenda usually begins with introductions for new faces, followed by each presentation with a period of Q and A.¬† I also book a restaurant for after the meetup for those of us that can stay back to continue networking in a social setting.</p>\n<p>Thursday's meetup was great, with presentations on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dissecting an advertisement, which led to some great discussions on marketing, including the AIDA principle (Attention, Interest, Desire, and call to Attention); the power of testimonials, in particular audio/visual testimonials; and the positives and negatives of the long sales letters / landing pages that we're used to seeing from internet marketers;</li>\n<li>Web Site Communicator - one of the members gave a live demonstration of <a href=\"http://www.websitecommunicator.com/\">Web Site Communicator</a> - basically the next generation of 'click to chat' support but live webcam chat instead of just instant messaging.¬† At first this looked a bit creepy to some of us but after discussion I could see the advantages.¬† This is a fairly new product though so there's not much data on the actual effectiveness of this vs traditional live support website modules;</li>\n<li>How Obama used web 2.0 technology to help win the election.¬† This was a great presentation.¬† As I have an interest in both politics and internet technology I found it really interesting, particularly as Indhra, who was giving the presentation, clearly had a good academic grasp of US political history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The beauty of these events is getting to pick the brains of the people that attend.¬† Amongst the group we had some real internet business success stories and it was great to hear real-life data on what works and what doesn't.¬† Of particular interest to me was the experience people have had using <a href=\"http://www.elance.com\">elance.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.getafreelancer.com/\">getafreelancer.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guru.com\">guru.com</a> and similar such sites to outsource work, the quality of that work, and how much was paid.</p>\n<p>I also got some good tips from David Toomey who owns <a href=\"http://www.supergreenme.com\">supergreenme.com</a> - a new site which I'm definitely going to keep an eye on.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On a bit of a whim, we decided on Saturday to treat ourselves to some nice nosh and try out a restaurant we haven't been to before.  It's been quite a while since we've treated ourselves to a really good meal out.\nI did a search on google and looked at a few restaurant guides and came across the Lighthouse Restaurant in Cleveland, Brisbane.¬† Having visited Raby Bay many times we couldn't believe that we'd never heard of this restaurant which is just down the road from Raby Bay.</p>\n<p>The Lighthouse restaurant, as the name suggests, is situated next to a lighthouse on a spit of land sticking out into Moreton Bay (or is it Redland Bay?). It was pitch-black when we arrived and there's very little lighting in that area.  It all adds to the atmosphere though - we sat outside to eat and couldn't see the waves but could hear them gently lapping against the bank just a few metres in front of us.</p>\n<p>The food was pretty good as well.  I had my usual favourite starter - mussels in white wine sauce, and followed this with 'Earth and Sea', described on the menu as '350 g grain fed rib fillet topped w ¬Ω Moreton Bay bug, prawns &amp; garlic cream sauce atop roasted chats &amp; seasonal greens. Delicious!  We had Lauren with us so we treated ourselves to dessert and shared some ridiculously tasty chocolate concoction and Croquembouche.</p>\n<p>It was a very good meal but we've all been on a serious health kick lately so all of that with wine and coffee was a bit of a shock to the digestive system and I for one felt like a bag of crap on Sunday.  Some serious detox needed!</p>\n<p></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This weekend gone we went up to <a href=\"http://www.mooloolabatourism.com.au/\">Mooloolaba</a> on the Sunshine Coast for a couple of nights.¬† Our neighbours, George and Julie, had already booked an apartment and encouraged us to do the same.¬† Unfortunately, when we went to book they only had 1 apartment left, on the Ground Floor.¬† It didn't sound too bad though with its own courtyard and spa.\n<div class=\"mceTemp\">\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width:250px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3515/3269387312_e5c5d14da4_m.jpg\" alt=\"Mooloolaba\" title=\"Mooloolaba\" /></dt>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>As it turned out our apartment was pretty crappy, but it wasn't a problem as we didn't spend that much time in it.</p>\n<p>George and Julie had managed to book a top-floor apartment with private rooftop and large spa, big enough to fit us all in - as we soon discovered shortly after arriving on Friday.¬† The idea behind this weekend was relexation and, for me, to catch up on some reading, so we spent Friday night drinking in the Spa and spent most of the day on Saturday around the pool.¬† Bliss.</p>\n<p>It wasn't all plain sailing though..</p>\n<p>On Friday night whilst in the spa a gust of wind came suddenly from nowhere and blew my iPod and iPod dock into the spa.¬† I desparately tried to revive them but even after drying them out for a couple of days they're now completely dead!</p>\n<p>Then on Saturday morning Lauren was complaining that her pee was burning so Rach nipped to the chemist who advised her to take Lauren to see the Doctor.¬† It was very inconvenient when I got the phone call from Rach telling me to bring Lauren to the Doctors, as we were in the pool at the time!¬† Anyway it turned out that Lauren has a bit of a bladder infection so she's now on anti-biotics.</p>\n<p>On Saturday afternoon we found ourselves drinking again on the rooftop, and fed up with drinking crappy Aussie beer we decided to venture out to see if we could find a pub that served a decent pint.¬† We thought we had read that there was a Pig 'n' Whistle in Mooloolaba (which serves Tetleys and Boddingtons, amongst others) but we were wrong, the Pig 'n' Whistle is a drive away in Maroochydore, so we took a walk to a pub George and Julie had visited previously.¬† Alas, not a pint of smooth ale to be found.</p>\n<p>On the way back from the pub the sun was setting so myself and George went for a swim in the sea before it got dark.¬† I say swim but there wasn't much actual swimming.¬† The waves were fairly large so we had some great fun trying not to drown.</p>\n<p>In the evening we went out for a meal.¬† We didn't think to book a table so had a bit of a nightmare trying to find somewhere where we wouldn't have to wait for an hour.¬† When we eventually did find somewhere it wasn't long before the kids were falling asleep so after the meal, Rach and Julie took the kids back to the apartment while I and George went to the pub.</p>\n<p>Our first attempt at getting into a pub was unsuccessful as we were both wearing shorts and for some stupid reason this pub, an Irish O'Malleys pub in sub-tropical Mooloolaba, had a dress policy which meant we had to wear trousers to get in.¬† I could understand it if it were a posh wine bar but it's an Irish pub for godsake!</p>\n<p>We ended up having a couple of pints in the Surf Club which was heaving, and before we left a fight broke out between a group of women.¬† It reminded me of being back in Doncaster!</p>\n<p>When I got back to the apartment I found Rach up and looking a bit panicked.¬† To my amazement she'd just had to put out a fire.¬† In her nighty!</p>\n<dl id=\"attachment_328\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width:235px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8ae13e1fc0.jpg\" alt=\"Burnt Chair\" title=\"Burnt Chair\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-328\" /></dt>\n</dl>\n<p>As it turned out, some idiot from an apartment above had thrown a cigarette butt into our courtyard which had landed on a towel which was flung over a chair.</p>\n<p>The towel duly caught fire and proceeded to burn through the chair.¬† The person who had thrown it must have realised what they had done and tried to put it out by throwing water from their apartment, as there was a pool of water just around the chair but nowhere else.¬† Rach had to put the fire out by smothering it using the wet end of the towel that hadn't yet caught fire.¬† She was not amused.¬† She reported it to the hotel staff who said they would investigate and compensate us for the towel.</p>\n<p><strong>The Blackall Range</strong></p>\n<p>On Sunday after checking out, George and Julie stayed behind in Mooloolaba for a few more hours whereas we took a drive up into the Glasshouse Mountains on the way home through the <a href=\"http://www.brbta.com/ghmts.php\">Blackall Range</a>.¬† We weren't exactly sure where we were going but we had an idea that we wanted to see one of the waterfalls.</p>\n<p>The drive up was spectacular and completely unexpected.¬† I had no idea how interesting and beautiful the scenery is up there.¬† When we managed to get up there that is - our little car really struggled with the steep incline.¬† I had my foot flat to the floor and I could smell the oil burning but we eventually made it.</p>\n<p>We started by driving into the small town of Maleny for a coffee and a visit to the tourist information centre to get our bearings.¬† The guy at the tourist information centre (another British expat - we're everywhere!) advised us to have a drive round to <a href=\"https://www.epa.qld.gov.au/projects/park/index.cgi?parkid=104\">Kondalilla Falls National Park</a>.¬† We took his advice and on the way stopped off at Gerards Lookout to take a few photo's of the fantastic view:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wFAGRBnzUw1VVKsaf2VBY9hQsQMtwULlNHcXzRjtgC8?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-H9yzw3hPZ_E/Tj4uNciMgqI/AAAAAAAACYA/H0Q9aHEsklo/s400/IMG_2294.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<p>We then drove through the lovely little town of Montville and continued on to Kondalilla Falls where we had a short trek through the rainforest down to a rockpool under part of the falls that we could swim in.¬† Both the trek down and the swim were quite a thrill.¬† When you live in a health and safety conscious environment most of the time it was great to be able to walk treks where there was no barrier between you and a 1000 foot drop down the side of the mountain, and where you could swim in natural waters with no lifeguard present.¬† Some idiots were even diving off the cliffs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AIcqrs8I2QaVhmDpuamS8thQsQMtwULlNHcXzRjtgC8?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-19O5pGYTQAE/Tj4wvtpXuoI/AAAAAAAACZ4/dzVbus-O_4o/s400/IMG_2321.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<p>The water was freezing but it was really refreshing given how hot it was in the rainforest.¬† Lauren also decided to brave it but soon changed her mind after getting in.¬† Being a rockpool there wasn't really anything to hold on to once in - you had to swim or tread water.¬† Lauren's a good swimmer now but she's still not that confident when she's out of her depth.</p>\n<p>The whole area of the Blackall Range is simply spectacular and being only 1.5 hours drive from our house we'll definitely be adding it to our list of weekend day-trip locations.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This week, the massive online job site Monster.com <a href=\"http://help.monster.com/besafe/jobseeker/index.asp\">released a security notice that their database had been hacked</a>, potentially releasing the personal details of millions of registered users.¬†¬† This isn't the first time this has happened, and I'm sure it won't be the last.<img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3274163fed.jpg\" alt=\"monster\" title=\"monster\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-321\" />\nLeave aside the fact that Monster don't seem to be encrypting passwords in their databases, which is extremely shoddy, this is a timely reminder of the importance of thinking about how we all use passwords.¬† The big threat with this type of attack is that if you tend to use the same passwords across multiple sites, if you're a Monster.com user (or user of their other international sites such as monster.co.uk), your password is now out in the open and could potentially be used to gain access to any other site that you've registered with using that password.</p>\n<p>So, it's dangerous practice to use the same password across multiple sites, but at the same time there's no way you're going to remember different passwords for all the sites you use.</p>\n<p>The answer to this problem is to use a password manager such as <a href=\"http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password\">1Password</a>.¬† This is a Mac application but there's also PC password managers such as <a href=\"http://www.roboform.com\">Roboform</a>.¬† The beauty of 1Password is that there's both a Mac version and a free iPhone version which can be set up to wirelessly sync between each other.¬† It also plugs in to the major web browsers (I use Firefox) so that it can automatically enter your username and password into the form each time you visit a site.¬† The way I use it is to let 1Password generate a random strong password for each site that I use, which then gets added to the application's database.¬† I now only have to remember one password - the password to open up 1Password.¬† The thing you have to remember with Password Managers though is that the encryption is only as strong as the one¬† password you use.¬† Therefore the normal rules apply - make it long, include numbers, letters (uppercase and lowercase) and special characters such as $.![\"]?*&amp;#\", etc.</p>\n<p>It's basic maths.¬† If an hacker tries a brute force attack against your password, the time it takes to crack your password will be dependant upon the number of variables in the characters you use, the length of the password, and the processing power of the application and PC used to try and crack the password.¬† Just by using both upper case and lower case letters you are doubling the number of characters that the password cracker must use, from 26 to 52.¬† Add numbers and the figure becomes 62, and then there's a large number of special characters you can use to add even more possibilities.¬† Then, every time you increase the length of your password you are increasing the strength to the power of x.¬† Although, this can be undermined if the application you use doesn't 'salt' your password and the hacker uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table\">Rainbow Tables</a>, but I won't go in to that here.</p>\n<p>When using a Password Manager it's also important to set a time out value in the settings so that you're required to re-enter your master password after a period of time, just in case your PC/Mac/iPhone gets stolen while you have a session open.</p>\n<p>If you are using the same password for multiple sites by using something like <a href=\"http://openid.net/\">OpenID</a>, it's particularly important to make sure your OpenID password is strong.</p>\n<p>I'm in no way affiliated with 1Password, honest, I just think it's a particularly useful application!</p>\n<p>You can find news of other hacked websites at <a href=\"http://www.breachblog.com/\">The Breach Blog</a>.</p>\n",

Nite match 2mrw. 2nd on rod laver', which for all you oldies translates as 'Had a couple of hours of tennis practice at Kooyong today.¬† It was hot again.¬† I have a night match tomorrow.¬† I will be second on the Rod Laver court'.\n</span></p>\n<p>Twitter was founded as a micro-blogging service in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/jack\">@Jack</a>), Biz Stone (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/biz\">@Biz</a>), and Evan Williams (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/ev\">@ev</a>), which makes sense when you know that Evan Williams was also the founder of <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com\">Blogger</a>, which he sold to Google in 2003.¬† I remember at the time many commentators dismissing it as a fad and pointless, wondering how useful it could be when your posts are restricted to just 140 characters.</p>\n<p>I wonder if they're still saying the same now?</p>\n<p>This week <a href=\"http://www.hitwise.com\">Hitwise</a> released figures showing the amazing growth of Twitter within the UK, which has increased ten-fold within the past 12 months.¬† Twitter‚Äôs penetration per head is even deeper in the UK than in the US. It ranked as the 291st most visited website in the UK, while in the USA it ranked 350th. It‚Äôs popular amongst the young, but the fastest growing age group of users is 35-44 year olds, who now account for 17.3% of UK visitors.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\">\n<dl id=\"attachment_314\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width:520px;\"> \n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/65991fa9bd.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter UK traffic growth 2008-2009\" title=\"Twitter UK traffic growth\" class=\"size-full wp-image-314\" /></dt>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>I'm not sure what the penetration is here in Australia but it certainly seems to be taking off.</p>\n<p>I've been using Twitter for about 15 months now.¬† I mainly started using it out of curiousity and as a way of keeping my facebook status updated without having to log in to facebook each time.¬† The beauty of twitter being that you can send 'tweets' via text message.¬† Now of course there's also a plethora of applications that you can use to twitter from PC's, Macs and mobile phones.¬† I use <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284540316&amp;mt=8\">Twitterrific</a> on my iPhone so I no longer have to send text messages.¬† It's all very easy to link up.¬† When I publish this blog post my twitter account automatically updates my tweet feed to say I have a new blog post, which then in turn updates my facebook status.</p>\n<p>Social media in general is changing the way we all communicate and connect with each other.¬† Even the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7846446.stm\">Pope has launched a Vatican channel on YouTube</a>.¬† With the use of social media now ubiquitous amongst teenagers, I strongly believe schools should consider teaching kids about internet safety and etiquette, if they're not already.¬† Many people struggle to realise the social effects and privacy implications that this new technology has.¬† Just this week a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/7845946.stm\">41-year old UK man was found guilty of stabbing his wife to death after she changed her Facebook status to 'single'</a>.</p>\n<p>You can follow my not so interesting twitter feed <a href=\"http://twitter.com/darylh\">here</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Last night I held my January Brisbane Internet Business Meetup.¬† Of the 82 members (as of today) I think only 14 turned up but that didn't detract from what was a really good night.¬† In particular, our group was blessed by the presence of two genuine internet celebrities:\nYaro Starak is a blogger who I've been following for nearly 2 years now.¬† His blog - <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com\">entrepreneurs-journey.com</a> is one of the most popular and successful blogs about blogging and internet marketing there is.¬† He also has a highly successful blogging course - Blog Mastermined, amongst other things, and regularly guest posts on some of the biggest blogs on the web.¬† It was partly due to his well written and researched articles that inspired me to start learning about internet marketing and internet business in general.¬† It was great to get the opportunity to meet Yaro who has recently returned from spending 6 months travelling around the world, running his internet business from his laptop in whichever city he happened to be in at the time.</p>\n<p>Alborz Fallah is the owner of <a href=\"http://www.caradvice.com.au/\">caradvice.com.au</a> - one of the top car blogs in Australia.¬† I first heard of Alborz after listening to a <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/952/alborz-interview/\">podcast interview</a> that Yaro did with him, in which he tells the story of how writing about his passion while he had some quiet time working on an IT helpdesk turned into the amazing success story it is today.¬† Business schools should use his story as a case study of how a small nimble operation can take on and beat the industry giants!¬† Alborz is now living the dream - getting to test drive the best cars in the world.¬† He had me particularly envious when he recounted the story of his recent trip where he got to drive a <a href=\"http://www.bugatti.com/en/veyron-16.4.html\">Bugatti Veyron</a> across Europe, which at 1000HP and a price tag of $1.1 million Euros is the fastest production car in the world.</p>\n<p>It was great to meet Yaro and Alborz, as well as the other new faces that turned up.¬† I made some useful contacts, met some fellow british expats and got some information that will hopefully help me finally get expatsclick.com up and running.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This week I've been to Newcastle, and I didn't spot a single Geordie!\nActually, Newcastle in New South Wales does have some similarities with its namesake in north east England, and in some parts does look a lot like other areas on the north east coast of England.¬† It particularly reminded me of Scarborough, with its ruggedness and steep cliffs overlooking the beaches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.visitnewcastle.com.au/\">Newcastle in New South Wales</a> is the 6th most populous city and the site of the second European settlement in Australia, being discovered in 1797.¬† So it does have quite a bit of history, comparatively for Australia that is.¬† It's not a particularly large city, I'd say it's no bigger than the average size town in the UK.¬† However, it may be small but it certainly has a lot to offer.</p>\n<p>Whilst Newcastle in itself is not the most picturesque place in Australia, the surrounding area is absolutely beautiful, at least it is from the air.¬† When we were coming in to land I was amazed by the amount of greenery from vast untouched dense forests that surround the area, as well as the famous <a href=\"http://www.winecountry.com.au/\">vineyards from the nearby Hunter Valley region</a>.¬† I'll be definitely coming back here with Rach to tour the vineyards or enjoy a family break in <a href=\"http://www.portstephens.org.au\">Port Stephens</a>.</p>\n<p>I was only in Newcastle for a couple of days, doing some <a href=\"/blog/224/pci-qsa\">PCI security consultancy</a> for a client.¬† Luckily we managed to finish a little early on the first day, and that combined with daylight savings (Queensland is so backwards in that respect!) meant I was able make it to the beach and drive round the area while it was still light.</p>\n<p>Europcar rented me a Ford Falcon Wagon to get about in whilst I was there, which made a nice change from our shit-heap of a car.¬† I needed it because the client was based out in the suburbs.¬† I started off my little exploration by driving down to Nobby's Beach in East Newcastle.¬† It was still around 28 degrees and I was cursing the fact that I'd forgotten to bring any shorts with me or my swim shorts so I could take a dip.¬† It was still nice though.¬† I took my shoes and socks off and rolled up my jeans and walked along the edge of the surf watching the windsurfers and kite surfers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/3199771905/in/set-72157612572009987/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3422/3199771905_7eb2248a13_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Nobbys Beach - Newcastle\" class=\"aligncenter\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was fairly windy so the conditions were pretty rough.¬† There were still plenty of people in the sea though taking on the waves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I then went for a drive around the coastline.¬† The beaches aren't as nice as the ones near us on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast, but there is plenty of diversity, including beaches with rockpools and ocean baths.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/3200629602/in/set-72157612572009987/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3502/3200629602_e874560fbc_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Rockpools\" class=\"aligncenter\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I also went up to a scenic lookout where I got a fantastic view of the surrounding area.¬† Out at sea I spotted what looked like 7 oil tankers all lined up waiting to come into port.¬† They would more likely have been coal transporting ships - Newcastle being the largest coal port in the world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">After finishing my little tour drive I headed down to the new boardwalk <a href=\"http://www.honeysuckle.net/\">Honeysuckle development</a> on Newcastle Harbour where I had a delicious meal of mussells in white wine followed by Berkshire pork strip-loin at the <a href=\"http://www.silolounge.com.au\">Silo Lounge</a> restaurant and bar.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I forgot to take my camera with my to Newcastle but I still managed to get a few decent shots with my iPhone.¬† This one certainly isn't bad for the crappy iPhone camera...</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/3200621868/in/set-72157612572009987/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/3200621868_864ae00d8e_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Newcastle\" class=\"alignnone\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/sets/72157612572009987/\">More of my photo's from Newcastle on flickr</a>.</p>\n",

someone to start a group, I decided to start one myself.<span> </span>So in October I held my first Brisbane Internet Meetup Group at a caf√©/bar just outside the city centre.<span> </span>The event was immediately a success and all attendees (there were roughly 10 for the first month) said they found it really useful to be able to swap experiences, tips and ideas on everything related to Internet Business including marketing, web design, sales, blogging, social media, etc.</p>\n<p>The meetup is now a monthly event and the December get together was held on the 19<sup>th</sup> December and received the best turnout yet.<span> </span>At each meetup I get to meet new members over a meal and a few beers in an informal setting.</p>\n<p>As of today 68 members have joined my group.</p>\n<p><strong>Work Xmas Party</strong></p>\n<p>The following day, on Friday 20<sup>th</sup> December, I took Rach and Lauren to my work xmas party.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp

Day</strong></p>\n<p>Even though this was the second xmas we have spent in Australia, it still took some getting used to, and xmas day was very different to say the least.</p>\n<p>As well as me, Rach, Lauren, and Rach‚Äôs Mum and Dad, we had Cath and Bonnie around for xmas day.<span> </span>It was a really hot day so most of it was spent out in the garden, where we had xmas dinner, beautifully cooked by Rach with assistance from Cath.<span> </span>Rach went for the full works, even to the extent of devising, and laminating, a menu weeks before.</p>\n<p>Unlike xmas days in the UK which were mostly spent in a comatose state on the sofa, this one was pretty active.<span> </span>We had a couple of session of cricket in the garden, as well as a couple of sessions in the swimming pool, including one in-between the starter and main course!</p>\n<p>Most importantly, Lauren was happy with her presents.<span> </span>And so was I.<span> </span>Santa was kind enough to bring me Guitar Hero on the Wii which resulted in me turning into a rock God!<span> </span>My rendition of Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz is particularly good if I say so myself.<span> </span>Honestly, I got obsessed with the thing and I‚Äôm now considering going out and buying a real guitar!</p>\n<p><strong>Sun 28<sup>th</sup> @ Surfers Paradise</strong></p>\n<p>On the Sunday after xmas we went down to the Gold Coast and spent the day at Surfers Paradise.<span> </span>This was another hot day so we spent a good amount of time on the beach.<span> </span>Myself and Steve (Rach‚Äôs Dad) had some great fun getting knocked for 6 by the waves.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\">\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width:250px;\"> \n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Being a rather geeky James Bond fan I was very much looking forward to the Quantum of Solace.</p>\n<p>After the re-incarnation of James Bond in Casino Royale, which kept pretty much authentic to the original plot and character in Ian Fleming's novel, I had high hopes for QoS.  </p>\n<p>What a disappointment.</p>\n<p>Unlike the edgy, exhilarating and well-shot action scenes in Casino Royale, the action scenes in QoS were a bit far fetched at best, and for most parts, completely unwatchable at worst.  Unfortunately, it seems the Director and Editor had taken the comparison with the Jason Bourne films to heart and decided to follow this latest ridiculous trend of shooting scenes with a shaky hand-held camera and over-editing the scenes so much that the angle of shot changes with nearly every frame.  The result is you can't make out what's going on.  </p>\n<p>I can imagine that in 10 years time we'll look back at this period in film-making and think 'what was that all about? Who on earth thought it was a good idea to shoot big blockbuster action scenes with a hand-held camera and switch between cameras angles so fast that it gives the viewer motion sickness?'.  I think Paul Greengrass is a good British directory, and both the last 2 Bourne films which he directed and United 93 are great films, but they'd be even better if we could actually make out what's going on in the action scenes!  Please, please, stop it.  There's a time and a place.  For instance, it kind of works in films like Cloverfield.  In Cloverfield there's a reason it's shot with a hand-held camera.  It's part of the plot, and, it does add something to the reality of the scenes.</p>\n<p>Besides the bad editing, QoS also suffers from a rather thin plot.  The film is based on a short story written by Fleming, and fleshing a short story out into a feature movie was always going to be difficult.  But this just feels like treading water. Bond travels from one exotic location to another with very little rationale for why he's going there, except to chase down baddies.  It was as if the producers picked a few nice locations they wanted to visit in advance of making the film, and then wrote the script to fit around the locations.  </p>\n<p>One of the best things for me in Casino Royale was the quick and witty dialogue, especially between Bond and the love interest - Vesper Lynd.  There's hardly any of that in QoS.  The non-stop action leaves very little time for character building.  There's not much of a love interest either - not a classic one for bond girls!  Bond does get his end away with one civil servant, who incidentally meets a sticky end covered in oil, reminiscent of that famous scene in Goldfinger.  Her death is obviously a reference to Goldfinger where the character 'Jill Masterson' is killed and covered in gold paint.  The bond franchise seems to be trying to send a message - the currency of power in the early Bonds was gold and diamonds, whereas in 2008 the currency of power is oil.  QoS is that un-memorable that I can't even remember if he kisses the bond girl who survives to the end.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong. It's not a complete disaster.  QoS is still better than the average action film.  Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond and Judie Dench continues to do a good job as 'M'.  The action scenes where the camera stays still for a few seconds are really good.  It's certainly better than the later Pierce Brosnan bond films where some of the action got preposterously far-fetched.  Mind you, surviving a fall out of an airplane where his parachute only opened 10 metres off the ground, and running through a building engulfed in flames without getting even his eyebrows singed, was pushing it a little in QoS.</p>\n<p>In summary, watchable, but not a classic.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It's tropical storm season here at the moment and this year it has been particularly bad.  Tonight we've been treated to yet another fantastic lightning storm after a very hot day, but it was rather mild compared to what happened on Sunday 16th November when we had the worst storms for 30 years.</p>\n<p>Luckily we escaped the worst of it where we live on the south side of the Brisbane river.  No such luck for those in the northern suburbs, especially The Gap where my boss lives.</p>\n<p>This YouTube video shows how bad it got in The Gap.  In particular watch what happens from 1 minute and 30 seconds in:</p>\n<p>[youtube [www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skrnDGl1LxQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&w=425&h=344])</p>\n<p>My boss's house was without power for 4 days after this.</p>\n<p>On Thursday the 20th November we had another big storm, and this time I got caught in it.  I was working in the city at a client site and left a little early to go to my office for the first of our 2 Xmas parties - this one being the one where clients were invited.  In the office, we had the weather radar up on one of the Plasma screens so we could watch the storm coming in.  When we realised it was heading straight for us many of us decided to leave to try and get home before the worst of it reached us, particularly after what had happened the previous Sunday.  So I set off walking to the train station (as my usual bus didn't run that late) and got half way there when the heavens opened, and as is typical, I'd happened to have left my umbrella at the client site.</p>\n<p>The rain was coming down so ferociously that I decided to take shelter in a shop entrance and wait until the worst of it was over, thinking that it would only be a short one.  Twenty minutes later it was still horizontal rain so I thought bugger it and set off again on a brisk walk.</p>\n<p>Near the train station there is an area where I need to cross two major roads with a traffic island in the middle. I crossed the first road and just as I got to the traffic island the hailstones started.  I couldn't believe it.  Whilst waiting for the traffic lights to change, in a very short period of time the hailstones started coming down faster and in increased size.  I was watching them fall all around me - the size of golf balls.  The thing is, for that short period of time I had absolutely nowhere to hide.  I was stuck, and the hailstones were coming down that hard I thought to myself if one of these hits me smack on the head I'm going to be in trouble. Yet, the unbelievable part is that none of them hit me.  They were falling all around my feet yet I managed to stand through it for a good 2 minutes before the traffic lights change, and then run across the road to shelter without a single one hitting me.  </p>\n<p>Talk about lucky!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>In just a few hours time, after what's been the longest, most expensive, and perhaps most exciting presidential election ever, we'll know who is going to be the 44th President of the United States.</p>\n<p>Being a political news junkie, I've been following the race fairly closely for the last 18 months, and, like pretty much the rest of the world outside of America, I'm praying (figuratively speaking given I'm an atheist) that Barack Obama wins.</p>\n<p>The world can't handle another 4 years of a Republican administration in the White House.</p>\n<p>A while back I read Bill Clinton's autobiography - 'My Life', and he stated that although history will ultimately judge his presidency, his own view was based on a simple mental list he kept:- jobs created, increased access to healthcare, increased funding for childcare, number of people lifted out of poverty, etc.</p>\n<p>Now lets apply that principle to George W. Bush.  Here's my mental list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 4,500 coalition troop deaths in the Iraq War and hundreds of thousands civilian casualties resulting from a war, lest we forget, which was sold to us based on the threat of weapons of mass destruction which never materialised;</li>\n<li>The trampling of human rights and civil liberties via the Patriot Act, Extraordinary Rendition, Water Boarding torture, Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, and other such terms we had all never heard of before 2001;</li>\n<li>The failure to sign the Kyoto Treaty, and furthermore, the continual effort to block and hamper the fight against climate change;</li>\n<li>The abysmal failure to act or show any leadership in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina's devastation of New Orleans;</li>\n<li>The complete wipeout of the federal budget surplus and creation of America's biggest ever budget deficit;</li>\n<li>etc, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Maybe I'm being a bit unfair.  On the plus side he did give records amount of financial relief to AIDS riddled countries in Africa, and was the first US president to acknowledge that a two-state solution was the only way to resolve the Israeli-Palestine issue.</p>\n<p>However, on the first, the amount of money given to the fight against AIDS ($30bn if I remember correctly) now seems a pittance in comparison to the $1 trillion spent on the Iraq War to date and the $700 bail-out of the banks (a figure which looks like it could double).  And on the second, what progress has been made?  We seem no closer to a solution now than 8 years ago.  At least 8 years ago there was no wall built around the West Bank.  Given what many people believe are the root-causes of 9/11, you'd think that pushing the middle-east peace process would be right up there with catching Osama Bin Laden.  Yet both seem to have took a back seat to what I believe is Bush's number one priority - 'Energy Security'.</p>\n<p>I remember a few years ago visiting the White House website to see what his administration had to say about climate change.  If you go there now there is a section titled Environment but a few years ago no such section existed.  Yet there was a section titled Energy Security.</p>\n<p>Some cynics may say that Energy Security was the entire basis for the invasion of Iraq.  After all, we all know that the Bush family's links to the oil companies are long and well documented.</p>\n<p>The last 8 years have been a disaster and George W. Bush will probably be remembered as one of the worst and most unpopular American presidents ever.</p>\n<p>So, will we see an end to this darkness?</p>\n<p>I'm not naive enough to think that America will completely change its foreign policy and stance on climate change overnight if Barack Obama wins. </p>\n<p>Lets just hope it is a new direction and an Obama win will go some way to reverse the damage inflicted by 8 years of the Neo-Cons in charge.</p>\n<p>As for John McCain, I had a lot of respect for him before this process began.  I've read about his 6 years imprisonment and torture during the Vietnam war, and his refusal to be released ahead of his compatriots.  He truly is a war hero.  But the way he has fought this campaign has surely undone a lot of the goodwill many people had for him.</p>\n<p>Some political analysts say that he has simply learnt from his 2000 campaign to become the Republican presidential nominee against George Bush.  In that campaign he mainly refused to go negative and resort to nasty tactics.  Bush on the other hand had no such qualms and many Americans, bombarded with adverts and push-poll phone calls, fell hook, line and sinker for the Bush campaign's smear tactics.</p>\n<p>McCain has clearly taken some political campaigning lessons from Karl Rove and thrown his morals out of the window.  At every step he has attempted to dumb the campaign issues down to the lowest common denominator; painting complex issues as black and white, and virtually labeling Obama as everything from a terrorist to a socialist.</p>\n<p>The soundbites coming out of the McCain team over the last few weeks since the economic meltdown really has represented a low-point in intellectual debate.  How many times did McCain quote Obama as using the words 'share the wealth', insinuating that Obama is somewhere to the left of Karl Marx with his policy of reducing income tax on the middle tax, as opposed to McCain's policy of cutting corporation tax for big business.  It amazes me how that word 'socialist' is used in american politics.  It's as if no american has ever visited Western Europe and seen the balance between economic growth and state welfare that has given a high standard of living with free(ish) health care for all.</p>\n<p>Obviously I'm making grand generalisations here.  It's mainly commentators on the right side of politics in America (right as in opposite to left, not right as in opposite to wrong), such as the state news channel that is Fox News that have done the most to brainwash some Americans into believing that all the issues are black and white; free-markets - good, regulation - bad; religion - good, atheism - bad; etc.</p>\n<p>I sometimes play a little game.  I put on the Bill O'Reilly show on Fox News and see how long it is until I want to throw a brick at the TV or start laughing uncontrollably in an effort to hide the tears of frustration at the ridiculousness that is the pompous, egotistical Bill O'Reilly.  It's been particular amazing to hear his rants lately against the democratic bias of the MS-NBC news channel.  Talk about 'pot this is kettle'.</p>\n<p>Anyway, speaking of black and white, some commentators are looking out for the purported Bradley Effect to see if the polls are wrong and McCain can clutch victory from the claws of defeat.  The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">Bradley Effect</a> is a theory that many voters tend to lie in polls when asked if they voted for the black candidate because they don't want the pollster to think that they are racist.  I guess we'll find out in a few hours time whether there are truths to this theory.</p>\n<p>I've been watching the Emmy award-winning drama John Adams over the last few weeks which is currently showing over here.  I wonder what Adams, Washington, Franklin, et all would make of the circus that now exists as a result of Article 2 of the United States Constitution?  Whatever happens, these are certainly interesting times we are living through.</p>\n",

First, while he got through most of his hits, he didn't do some of my favourite songs, such as 'Do I Do' and 'Blowin' in the Wind' (yes, I know that last one was a Bob Dylan cover), instead choosing to sing some more obscure songs which I, and everyone else judging by the lack of reaction, didn't know.  They were still good though.  Second, he let some 14 year old competition winner go up and sing 'I Just Called to Say I Love You', and she killed it (not in the good way).</p>\n<p>He did a few jazz numbers, which is always fine by me, making use of the wide range of instruments in his band.  He even started off with a Miles Davis number, showing off his skills on the harmonica.</p>\n<p>All in all it was a really good night - 2 and a half hours of great music.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3042/2976530119_90918dabca_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3042/2976530119_90918dabca_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;margin:0 auto 10px;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:500px;height:375px;\" /></a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I'm very busy on the work front at the moment, both in my day job and with the internet business.</p>\n<p>In my day job I'm involved in a major, very complex, government PKI project.  PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure and is basically a set of systems that can be used for issuing and signing digital certificates that can be used for encryption, authentication and other security type things.  The thing about PKI is it's all about trust.  If you're going to use a digital certificate to encrypt your communications, or use it for authentication (such as to gain access to a website, or even to a building by putting the certificate on a building access card) both you, and the owner of the systems, need to have confidence that the certificate hasn't been compromised in any way.</p>\n<p>What this means is that every aspect of how the certificate is created, issued, renewed, revoked, used, and stored has to be managed in a way that covers all the potential security risks.</p>\n<p>My job is to create a framework of rules around the entire PKI, covering everything from the physical security of the buildings and servers which will host the PKI, the security procedures for the operation of the PKI, the HR procedures to ensure the people operating the PKI can be trusted, to the technical security controls of the particular systems.</p>\n<p>The framework has to be specific enough so it covers all the risks, but generic enough so that the PKI can be future-proof and used for multiple different purposes.</p>\n<p>I've also got to write the audit procedures so that they can get an outside auditor to come in and carry out annual audits of every Certificate Authority that wants to operate under the PKI (of which there may be many covering multiple government agencies) in accordance with the procedures I've written.</p>\n<p>To say it's making my head hurt is an understatement.  There's particular international standards that I need to make sure it complies with, as well as fitting in with government standards around authentication and identity management.</p>\n<p>My little brain is struggling to cope!</p>\n<p>As for our internet business. <a href=\"http://www.ipchitchat.co.uk/\">IPChitChat</a> is doing pretty well.  We've had some good feedback on the new site, and most importantly, revenue was up for last month considerably from Sept 2007.  We're still some way from making a full-time living out of it but it's growing, slowly but surely.</p>\n<p>We've also launched <a href=\"http://www.ezeequit.co.uk/\">EzeeQuit</a>, which is more of an experiment than anything else.  Probably won't be a long term venture but it demonstrated we can now react to new opportunities and get an e-commerce site up relatively quickly.</p>\n<p>We've also changed the name of our company.  We originally registered the company as Autonomy Business Solutions Ltd when we had the idea of creating an IT Managed Service for medium to small businesses.   Our business model has changed considerably since then and we're now concentrating on building internet-based brands.</p>\n<p>We're really interested in the whole new phenomenon of cloud computing, the whole idea of applications moving away from the desktop to being purely web-based.  With that in mind we've now changed our business name to NetCloud Ltd, which we believe better reflects the ethos of the business.  We couldn't get netcloud.co.uk so our domain name for NetCloud Ltd is <a href=\"http://www.netcloudgroup.co.uk/\">www.netcloudgroup.co.uk</a>.  This is ok as NetCloud will effectively be a group of companies under the netcloud banner.  There's not much on that website yet but it will grow as our underlying businesses grow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/a23b6-netcloud_logo.gif\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e90b3f1ee8.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5258004499380643778\" /></a></p>\n<p>So our existing websites are keeping us busy, there's day-to-day management of the site, marketing and development of more features, as well as troubleshooting the odd issue that comes up here and there.  I'm currently putting together the next newsletter for IPChitChat which you can sign up for on our site.</p>\n<p>And of course there's the development of our next sites.  The social networking site I've mentioned previously has been completed (to some degree) by the developers we hired in India, and I'm now working on developing features and content.  Not sure when we'll get this one off the ground as it's a major project but it's certainly an exciting prospect.</p>\n<p>We also have a couple more ideas for e-commerce sites that we're investigating.</p>\n<p>All in all life is busy on all fronts.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Yesterday when I went to get on the bus to work I realised I'd forgotten my Go card, which is basically an electronic card you can use with the Brisbane transport system - I can top the balance up online and simply touch on and off buses and trains, and it automatically gets deducted (it's basically an RFID card like the Oyster system in London).</p>\n<p>Anyway I had a look round for it this morning and couldn't find it, so I went online to check the last transaction.  It seems some cheeky twat has been using it for the last 2 days.  I can see that he/she got on a bus this morning on my route and got off in the city, obviously using my card to get to work and back. </p>\n<p>I've rang up and cancelled it but of course, it's not as simple as cancelling the card and sending me a new one.  I have to order a new one (which will cost $10), and then complete and post a form for them to transfer the balance of the account from the old card to the new one.  All of which will probably take weeks knowing how council departments work.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure whether I lost it or someone pick-pocketed me.  I've realised it must have been Wednesday evening.  I remember Wednesday evening because we had a monsoon.  I got off the bus to walk the remaining distance home and got caught up in absolutely amazing freak weather conditions.  Apparently during that brief storm, which lasted about an hour, we had over 3000 lightning strikes. </p>\n<p>I've never seen anything like it.  Only muggins here was stupid enough to be outside walking the streets in it.  I remember having this gut feeling that I was going to be struck by lightning any second, as everyone else was inside or in their car (apparently your car is the safest place to be during lightning).  Also, living in sunny climes I didn't have a jacket or umbrella with me so I was absolutely drenched by the time I got home.  At least it was warm rain.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/thunderstorm-batters-brisbane/2008/10/15/1223750073470.html\">this Brisbane Times story</a> it dumped down nearly 60mm of rain in that 1 hour and 32,000 homes lost power.</p>\n",

Bribie Island is approx an hour's drive north of Brisbane and the only Island close to Brisbane that is connected by a bridge.</p>\n<p>We started out at Bongaree which is on the South East of the Island.  Being on the sheltered side of Bribie this is a lovely little village that is ideal for young kids, as there's virtually no surf.  There's a small beach with a pier, which is surrounded by parklands with plenty of BBQ areas and children's play areas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3027/2878819164_62019a5fbe_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3027/2878819164_62019a5fbe_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;margin:0 auto 10px;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3077/2878809788_ca13cf3563_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3077/2878809788_ca13cf3563_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;margin:0 auto 10px;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>From Bongaree you can get a view of the bridge back to the mainland.

Only time will tell to see if it can compete with Internet Explorer in terms of market share.  For me, Firefox is the best browser out there but it still only has a 20% share of the market - even IE6 which is ancient in Internet years has a bigger share of the market than Firefox. </p>\n<p>Will Google be able to leverage its search engine dominance to make Chrome bigger than IE?</p>\n<p>I've downloaded and tested Chrome.  My first thoughts were I like the clean look and feel.  Secondly, it's clearly faster than both Firefox and IE, which is a major bonus.  I also like the fact that each tab acts as its own 'sandbox', so that if a website causes the browser to crash, which happens a lot in IE and Firefox, it will only cause that tab to crash and not the entire browser.</p>\n<p>So does that mean that I'll ditch Firefox and start using Chrome?  Not likely yet.  The biggest draw for me with Firefox is the plugins.  There are currently no plugins or extensions for Chrome.  That means no easy <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615\">del.icio.us bookmarking</a>, no <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/138\">stumbleupon toolbar</a>, no <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6076\">Better Gmail</a>, no <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3209\">GTDInbox</a> for gmail, and no <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843\">Firebug</a>, to name but a few of the plugins I rely on.  As Chrome is open-source I'm sure it will only be a matter of time before the plugins start appearing.</p>\n<p>Also Chrome is only currently available for Windows, although a Mac version is in the works.</p>\n<p>Hopefully by the time the Mac version is released they'll also have some decent plugins, in which case Google Chrome it will be.<br /><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/bb1c4-gchrome.gif\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cd4b15edd0.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5241599895256753634\" /></a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<div>It was only 4 years ago, yet I can remember very little about the 2004 Athens Olympics.  Some of the sporting achievements stick out, such as Kelly Holmes winning 2 Gold Medals, the Men's 4x100 team winning Gold, and the discovery of Amir Khan.  However, I can hardly remember a thing about the 2004 opening and closing ceremonies.</p>\n</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>I'm sure I won't be saying the same about the Beijing Olympics 4 years from now.</p>\n</div>\n<div> </div>\n<p> China certainly pulled all the stops out to make this probably the most enjoyable Olympics ever.  Of course, it's not so hard to pull off an amazing show when you can throw unlimited money at it; the cost of the Beijing Olympics was over twice the budget for the London Olympics.  I guess it's easier to raise the funds when you've got a single-party political system.</p>\n<p>I've certainly never been as engrossed in the Olympics as I was this time round.  There were so many amazing moments.  It helps of course that Team GB did outstandingly well, and I also had the bonus of being able to support the Australian athletes.</p>\n<p>It will be good to get an early night tonight after staying up most nights after midnight following the coverage.  I'm glad I did though.  It wouldn't have been the same watching Usain Bolt break both the 100m and 200m world records in a replay the day after.</p>\n<p>Last night's closing ceremony certainly lived up to expectations after the amazing opening ceremony.  I'm not too sure about the 8 minute London contribution though.  They were never going to be able to compete with the grand majesty of what Beijing were offering, nor should they.  But to say that 8 minute segment alone cost ¬£2.5 million, I was expecting a little more.  Perhaps I was expecting David Beckham to kick the ball 200ft into the air only for it to explode with a thousand Union Jack parachutes descending into the stadium?  Seriously though it wasn't so much what they did, it was the general theme that I found a little disappointing.  Please, give it a rest with the stereotypical stuff (it doesn't always rain in London (thanks to global warming), and not everyone goes to work on a red London bus).  Also, give it a rest pushing London's cultural diversity down our throats.  Yes, we know London is a conglomerate of lots of different ethnic communities, but so is Sydney, and New York, and Paris, and most other major capitals around the globe these days.</p>\n<p>I really hope that in 2012 they try to be less funky and concentrate more on celebrating British history and culture.   Britain's got an amazing story to tell - think Shakespeare, Newton, Darwin, Raleigh, Drake, The Battle of Britain, The Beatles, the countless inventions and discoveries, and not forgetting the sports that Britain gave to the world - football, cricket, tennis, golf, rugby, even Table Tennis, to name but a few.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the London handover bit even though it was a little cringeworthy.  I thought 'Whole Lotta Love' went down pretty well, and although it's getting a bit tired dragging Beckham out each time for these events, it probably was appropriate given his involvement in the bid as well as the fact that he is bigger than Jesus in Asia.  Not just Asia, he draws a crowd everywhere.  LA Galaxy are playing in Brisbane later on this year and you can bet that the stadium will be completely sold out.</p>\n<p>Roll on 2012.  I tell you though, if the opening ceremony of 2012 involves a thousand mixed-race kids wearing bowler hats and singing in cockney accents I'll happily surrender my British passport for good!</p>\n",

If you get any Aussies throwing out the same line that 'it's not England, you can only beat us if you combine your countries', just point out to them that most of Australia's golds have come from Queenslanders.  In fact, my home town of Brisbane is doing pretty well.  Brisbane's Stephanie Rice is bringing home 3 gold medals.  We're all very proud!</p>\n<p>Actually, the Aussie sour grapes aren't as bad as the UK media makes out.  The news reporters over here have expressed surprise at how well team GB as done, but I have found when I've watched the games that if Australia isn't represented in a particular event they do get behind the Brits.  I've even heard the words 'the Brits are awesome this year' come out of the TV.</p>\n<p>It's all to do with the Commonwealth you see.  I think I've heard the word 'Commonwealth' mentioned more times in the 15 months I've lived in Australia than the entire 32 years I lived in the UK.  I thought the 'Commonwealth' was pretty much a dead term only to be brought out for the Commonwealth games, until I arrived here.  Not so, the antipodeans love it.  Australian federal law is even known as Australian Commonwealth Law, which is passed in the Australian Commonwealth Parliament.</p>\n<p>I wonder if the Commonwealth would be more important to Britain if GB wasn't part of the EU?</p>\n<p>I'm happy to support both GB and Australia in the Olympics, which, as the time of writing, puts my personal Gold tally at 27 - more than the US!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I find it pretty cynical that whilst the rest of the world's media is following the IOC official Medal Table, i.e. ranking countries by Gold, then Silver, then Bronze, which currently puts China at the top, the big US media companies are instead ranking countries by total medals won, which of course puts the US in the #1 position.</p>\n<p>Come on American, face up to it, the world order is changing.  The 20th Century may be known as America's Century but things are quickly changing, and I'm not just talking about sport.  The Olympics medal table as always been a good indicator for the general world order - and all the indicators point in the direction of the US heading south.  Just look at the decline of the US dollar.</p>\n<p>Now I'm not a proponent of the European Union forming an EU olympics team, but just imaging if they did,  I can't be bothered to count up the total medals of the 25 EU nations but a quick glance at the medals table tells you that a EU team would have more than twice the amount of medals as the US.  Now there's an idea, albeit not a good one.</p>\n<p>With most of the Athletics events still to come there's a good chance that the US will still finish at the top of the table, using both methods of ranking, given that China's medal hopes come mainly from non-Track and Field events.  It would be nice though if China did end up with more Golds and more total medals than the US.  How would  ESPN, NBC, CNN/SI, etc manipulate the tables to put the US top then?</p>\n",

His work turned out to be really shoddy.  It's our own fault, we should have done better due diligence when choosing the developer.</p>\n<p>After getting rid of the web developer there was so much work to do to try and get the site looking the way we wanted that we decided it would be quicker to start again.  I'd learnt so much trying to fix the work he had done that I had confidence that I could do a better job myself.  I'm not sure I'd do it again.  You wouldn't believe the amount of hours work it takes to create a site such as this, particularly when it's all open-source (using free software) to save money.  If we'd have spent a fortune on a top e-commerce system then I'm sure it would have only took half the time.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it has taken a lot longer than planned to get this site up and running, and there may still be the odd bug or two that we need to iron out, but I'm happy with the results.</p>\n<p>So how does this differ to our old site - <a href=\"http://www.ipchitchat.com\">ipchichat.com</a>, you might ask?  Well, it's like comparing a Mac to a ZX Spectrum.  The old site was completely built by hand using html.  None of the site is database driven and we had to use a third-party to provide our shopping cart and checkout.</p>\n<p>In the new site, the whole site is run using a proper content management system.  Everything is database driven, making it much easier to manage and make changes to the site on the fly.  We've integrated a proper shopping cart system, and now have our own SSL certificate so users can checkout within the site.  We've got a blog, a download area - where users can download user guides, firmware, etc.  Users can properly manage their account information on the site, and see their order history.  We've got different account types for regular shoppers, corporate accounts, and resellers; meaning that users will automatically get discounts on products depending on their account type.  We've got an help-desk system where users can submit support requests, and they will receive a support ticket, which is managed through our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.  The list goes on. We've also greatly extended the range of products we offer.</p>\n<p>Over the coming months we've also got plans to introduce even more features.</p>\n<p>Check it out at <a href=\"http://www.ipchitchat.co.uk\">www.ipchitchat.co.uk</a> - you can even sign up to our e-mail newsletter.</p>\n",

				"title": "Finally on ADSL",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>After 14 months of trying, we've finally been able to get ADSL.  Hooray!! </p>\n<p>I've been applying fairly regularly ever since we arrived in Oz but kept receiving the same reply - \"no available ports on the exchange\". </p>\n<p>However, after being told ADSL had been activated for my line (it only took a couple of days), getting it working wasn't without a few hiccups.  I spent about 5 hours on the phone to my ISP over the weekend trying to get it working.  I'd configured my router exactly as instructed, and I could see from the logs that ADSL was active with the correct link speeds in both directions, it just wouldn't connect to the PPPoE Server at the ISP. </p>\n<p>The first idiot that I spoke to at the ISP was certain that it must be a problem with my router.  I new it was't, but they wouldn't escalate the call any further until I tried out another router.  So I had to go out and buy a second router.  I got it home, plugged it in and configured it and of course, still wouldn't connect.  So I got on to my ISP again and then for about 3 hours they kept swapping me between customer services and technical support; technical support passed me to customer services because they thought the line hadn't been activated because they couldn't see any codes on the line (even though I could see it was activated from my own logs), and customer services passed me back to technical support because they had confirmation from Telstra that the line was activated.  I got passed back and forth 3 times.  I swear they do it on purpose to rack up the cost of my call to their premium number support line.</p>\n<p>Eventually they realised it must be a problem on the line and they would need to escalate it to Telstra (similar to BT in the UK).</p>\n<p>The next day, I discovered that my phone line was completely dead - couldn't even get a dial tone.  So I got in touch with the ISP but they couldn't do anything and told me to ring Telstra.  The thing is, Telstra aren't my phone company, my contract is with Optus.  If I were to ring Optus and mention the problems I had with ADSL they would surely just tell me to ring my ISP as it must be related to that call.  If I were to ring Telstra they would just tell me to ring Optus as I'm not a customer of Telstra.  I decided to just wait and see what happens.</p>\n<p>2 days later the phone line is still down, so I'm just about to ring my ISP when I hear on the news that the entire Optus network (phone, internet, mobile) is down in Queensland and parts of New South Wales.  As it turned out a digger had cut through a fibre optic core line on the Gold Coast.  It caused havoc - even to the point where Brisbane airport had to shut down operations due to no communications.  What about the backup line you may ask, where was the resiliance?  Well, this incident happened at exactly the time when their backup line was also down due to a completely unrelated hardware failure.  A one in a million incident according to Optus.</p>\n<p>When the Optus network came back up, I went home, checked my line and low and behold I had ADSL!</p>\n<p>I've now ended up with 3 wireless routers.  The third one is one I bought a couple of weeks ago after discovering that my Mac couldn't connect to my original wireless router due to a conflict between the chipsets.  I still wanted to use my original router because it's a good one (Draytek Vigor 2600g) so I just went a purchased an extra wireless access point that I new I'd be able to connect to - an Apple Airport Express.  What I discovered this week though, and I really don't know why this didn't dawn on me in the first place, is that just as my Mac can't connect wirelessly to my Draytek router, the Apple Express can't either because it uses the same chipset.   The money I've wasted this week is unreal.</p>\n<p>They other 2 routers won't go to waste though.  I've decided on a configuration like this if I can get it to work:</p>\n<p>Telephone connected into my Dlink wireless router downstairs.</p>\n<p>Draytek router upstairs acting as a wireless client.  This will have have a fixed ethernet connection to my spare PC (that I use for extra storage).  It will also have a fixed ethernet connection to my SIP Voice over IP Phone so that I can make free calls to the UK.  Furthermore I'll be able to plug in my printer to the USB port on the router so that I can do wireless printing.</p>\n<p>As for the Apple router, this will also be a wireless client on the network and I'll be able to use the USB port on this to plug in my external hard drive so I'll have another wireless storage device.  I use this in conjunction with Time Machine on my mac which automatically backs up my data every hour.</p>\n<p>All very well in theory...</p>\n<p>Let the torrent downloads commence (only for legal distributions of course :-})!</p>\n",

Only 2 days ago Google lost a court case with Viacom (the parent company of MTV and Paramount Pictures) where the judge ruled that they must hand over the log files detailing everyone who has ever accessed a YouTube video.  This ruling could set a dangerous precedent.  It effectively forces one company to hand over personal user information to another company (Viacom is a company after all, not a federal agency) containing personal information related to millions of users around the world.  Google is appealing the decision and requesting that it be allowed to anonymise the data. </p>\n<p>We may have the Privacy Act in Australia, and the Data Protection Act in the UK, but that means absolutely nothing when your data is hosted on a server in the US.

Google Street View is criticised by privacy advocates because it could potentially show the faces of individuals.  Google can remove the image on request, which it has done for many instances in the US, but in the UK there is an argument that this could breach the Data Protection Act because they're not getting the user's consent before using the image.</p>\n<p>Google is currently trialling facial recognition software in the hopes of being able to automatically pixalate the face of anyone that might show up in it's images.</p>\n<p>By the way, you may not have seen the following picture.  Google have taken this down now but the original photo (below) accidentally caught someone pulling a gun out on a kid at the side of the road.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i30.tinypic.com/2e6g6ls.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i30.tinypic.com/2e6g6ls.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />I personally think Google Street Views is amazing and I can't wait for it to come to Australia.

				"content_text": "<p>I've finally found the perfect service for the Expat.  <a href=\"http://www.jaxtr.com/\">Jaxtr</a> is a service which makes international calls easier, cheaper and much more convenient.  It basically means that I can now make calls to the UK from my Australian mobile phone at a cheaper rate than calling from my home phone - even cheaper than using a calling card!</p>\n<p>It works by assigning you a local number in your country that you can call, which is then switched through jaxtr's VoIP network to the destination number you have assigned overseas.  So for instance, I simply go in to Jaxtr and enter my Dad's phone number in the UK, it then assigns me a local Australian number that I can use that will get forwarded to my Dad's number.  Calling UK numbers from Australia using Jaxtr costs 1 jax per minute, and you can purchase 1000 jax for $10 US, so basically it costs 1c per minute.  Of course you still have the cost of ringing the local Australian number, but on my Vodafone plan I get $150 worth of call for $29 so that's also really good.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/18b13-jaxtr-home.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5f3c2f45b0.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5219422444030107202\" /></a><br />Jaxtr works with most of the countries around the world and from my tests the call quality is really good.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jaxtr.com\">http://www.jaxtr.com</a></p>\n",

				"title": "Home for a Short Weekend",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I'm currently sat in the departure lounge at Canberra airport with a 3 hour wait for my flight.  Luckily I'm sat at a table that's near a bar, and also has a power socket I can use, so the combination of my laptop and Crown Lager should see me through.  It feels weird travelling home on a Saturday though.  There won't be much of a weekend left when I get home.</p>\n<p>I'm glad I stuck around for today's exercise as it was really enjoyable.  The hacking exercise was a lot harder than I expected.  The goal was to capture 4 flags.  These were basically text files called flag1.txt, flag2.txt etc that were stored on the each of 4 servers on the target network.  Each of the flags had a 'phrase that pays' and the end goal was to get the full phrase that pays and be the first person to whisper it into the ear of the instructor.  Two of the servers were Windows servers and two were Linux.  I was fairly confident I'd be able to handle the Windows Servers (I did used to be a Microsoft Enginner after all) but it was the Linux Server that worried me.  My Linux skills are quite rudimentary and there were some really experienced techies in the class who I new I had no chance of beating.   Suffice to say I didn't win the competition.  Nor did I manage to get all the flags in the alloted time.  I did manage to get 3 out of the 4 though.</p>\n<p>The Windows servers turned out be fairly easy to exploit.  The first one that I managed to connect to had the old null sessions vulnerability so I was able to connect to it using an anonymous account.  Once I had a netbios session I was able to enumerate the accounts and grab a copy of the SAM password list.  I then used a password cracker to crack an account that had admin privilages and then simply mapped a drive to it.  Easy peasy.</p>\n<p>The other servers weren't that easy.  One of the servers had some firewall or routing restrictions so it was only accessible from one of the other servers.  So I had to compromise one server and then use that has a launching pad to compromise the other server.  To make things trickier still, it turned out that one of the flags.txt files was hidden.  There's a thing called NTFS Alternate Data Streams on Windows where it's possibly to hide a file in the data stream of another file or directory.  So when you browse the file directory it's completely hidden.  You can't even use file comparisons to detect the hidden file has it doesn't affect the file size or checksum of the file that it's attached to.  After a few hints I did manage to find it using a tool that discovers these hidden data streams, and also found a few other hacking tools hidden within the same directory that I could use to compromise one of the other servers.</p>\n<p>One of the other servers had a buffer overflow vulnerability so I used Metasploit to exploit that server and get a command shell.</p>\n<p>That's about as far as I got.  3 out of 4 isn't bad but I didn't get the full phrase.  After the instructor explained how to do it I realised I could have been at it for days.  One of the exploits was ridiculously hard.  It involved carrying out a cross-site scripting attack (XSS), but it wasn't as simply as launching the attack from my PC against the server.  No, it involved compromising one server, generating traffic from that server to another server, and then sniffing the traffic off the network to grab the session cookies and then using the session cookies as part of the attack.  That would have took me days to figure out!</p>\n<p>Anyway, the day was very geeky but thorougly enjoyable and challenging.  The 6 days course has been great but no one can really come out of a 6 day course and become a professional hacker or penetration tester.  We've covered dozens of hacking tools in the 6 days so of course there's a limit to the depth that you can go into for each tool given the alloted time.  Now I have the fundamentals I'll need to dig into the tools and techniques in detail and keep practicing to hone my skills.  Luckily these days with VMWare I can easily do that by simulating an whole network on my laptop.  All week I was running Windows XP and Red Hat Linux in virtual machines as guest operating systems whilst still using my Mac OSX Leoopard operating system as the host, and didn't have any problems - basically running 3 different PC's on my one mac.</p>\n<p>One of the things that I'll take away from this course is that it doesn't take the latest and greatest malware (viruses, etc) to compromise a system.  Some of the best hackers simply use the in-built administration tools already resident on the systems.  That way there's little danger of triggering off the anti-virus software or intrusion prevention software.  For instance, the WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-Line) tool resident in all modern versions of Windows is a fantastic legitimate windows scripting tool that can be manipulated to do all sorts of nasty stuff.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hopefully I'll be able to put some of these new skills into practice on some real clients some time soon.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>This week I've made my first visit to our nation's capital - Canberra - for a 6-day course in Hacker Techniques, Exploits and Incident Handling.</p>\n<p>Canberra is a strange little city.  It seems to me to be a cross-between Washington and Milton Keynes, in that it's clearly a Government town; the Federal government being the largest employer in this capital city which has only a population of 300,000.  Yet like Milton Keynes, Canberra has an artificial feel to it.  You can see the planning and design - it's not a city that has grown organically like most others.  It's even got some of the same 60's carbuncles as Milton Keynes!</p>\n<p>I've come to Canberra completely ill-prepared for the freezing temperatures.  It's about 13 degrees C in the day but it drops down to zero at night.  I new what the temperatures would be before I arrived and I thought I'd be ok, after all I am from the UK!  However, I didn't realise how much I've acclimatised to the Queensland weather over the past year.  13 degrees C feels to me like -5 did in the UK!  All I've brought is a thin jacket and some jeans and t-shirts.  I didn't even pack a jumper. </p>\n<p>Because it's so cold, tonight has been the first evening that I've dared to venture out.  I had a gander around the city centre (which isn't much bigger than Doncaster town centre) and then went to the flicks to watch Hancock.  I had planned to see the Indiana Jones film but the timing didn't work out very well, so then it was a toss-up between Hancock and Sex and the City.  No contest - I couldn't bear the thought of sitting through 2 hours of self-obsessed women talking about shoes and Prada handbags.</p>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised with Hancock. I thought it was just going to be just another dumb superhero movie but it was actually really good.  Of course the action scenes and special effects were good, that's a given, but this added in a really funny script, as well as some character development and a few twists and turns to boot.  Definitely one I'd recommend for 90 minutes of pure escapism.  I plan on seeing Indian Jones tomorrow night, If I can be brave enough to go out into the cold again.  I'm not expecting anything great from Indian Jones and the blah blah whatever-it-is as most of the reviews I've read have been pretty damning.  I'll try and keep an open mind.</p>\n<p>Being holed up in the National Convention Centre each days means I haven't had chance to take in any of the sights of Canberra.  All the things I'd like to see are only open during the day.  I'll probably come back here sometime in the future with Rach & Lauren.   In particular I'd love to take a tour of Parliament House and the National Museum of Australia.</p>\n<p>As for the course, i've really enjoyed it.  Over the past few months I've been quite dissolusioned with my career and frankly have been getting bored to death of doing security compliance work.  This course has re-awakened the geek inside me and allowed me to get back to my technical roots.  Learning the technicalities of how to break into systems is much more fun that just learning how to defend them!</p>\n<p>As much as the content of the course has been really good and up-to-date, the best bit about the course so far has been having access to the knowledge and experience of our tutor - Bryce Galbraith.  Bryce is very much an expert in this industry and is a contributing author to the bestselling book 'Hacking Exposed: Network Security Secrets & Solutions'.  He has worked with a ton of Fortune 500 companies and has also worked on Foundstone's world renowned Attack and Penetration team. </p>\n<p>Of course I had a decent knowledge of hacking before I came on this course (you're not much of a security consultant if you don't know how the bad guys exploit the vulnerabilities you're telling companies to fix), but this course has significantly enhanced my knowledge and brought it up to date with the latest exploits and attack vectors.  I'm looking forward to Saturday when we get to put all we've learnt into practice with a live 'capture the flag' exercise - where we all compete to hack into a system.</p>\n<p>I tell you, there's some scary stuff happening out there and there's a good reason to be paranoid about your computer security.  A lot of the myths around security have been dispelled this week.  Do you think I can't get around your personal firewall?  Think again!  Do you think I can't sniff your traffic on a switched network?  Think again!  You think your wireless network is secure because you've enabled WPA2 instead of WEP?  Think again!</p>\n<p>It's a shame this damn code of ethics prevents me from using my knowledge for evil.  I could be rich in no time!</p>\n",

				"title": "PCI QSA",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>This week I've been in Sydney on a training course to become a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) for the Payment Cards Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).</p>\n<p>The PCI-DSS is a standard jointly devised by VISA, Mastercard, American Express, JCB and Discover that details the security controls that must be in place to protect credit card data from electronic or paper theft.  Any company that processes, stores or transmits credit card data is now obliged to be compliant with PCI-DSS, and any company that isn't compliant are at risk of losing their merchant status (ability to accept credit cards) and suffering a fine.  As you can imagine, losing merchant status would mean end of business for many companies so this is a very big thing.</p>\n<p>As a QSA I will be carrying out audits of the larger merchants and providing a Report on Compliance (ROC) to their aquiring bank to testify whether or not they comply.  This is something I have to take very seriously because if I report that a company is compliant and then they get hacked, any fine incurred by the merchant could be passed on to my company if it can be proven that my report was innaccurate.  So any company that choses me as their QSA should not expect to get an easy ride!</p>\n<p>Only the larger merchants have to be audited by a QSA; smaller merchants can submit a completed Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) to their bank.  However, if the bank is unhappy with the answers in the SAQ they will tell the merchant that they are non-compliant, as many merchants are now discovering.</p>\n<p>It's not just merchants that I'll be able to audit either.  The banks themselves, classed as Service Providers, and other companies that process payments up the chain from the merchants could also be subject to my microscope.</p>\n<p>The requirements of PCI-DSS are quite stringent and for smaller merchants can be highly complex.  In the last couple of years I've been helping companies implement compliance programs to meet the requirements of PCI-DSS and accurately complete their SAQ.  Becoming a QSA takes me to the next level and authorises me to audit companies on behalf of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.  Although I'm a QSA I only retain my status as a QSA whilst working for a QSA Company (QSAC).  Vica-versa the company I'm working for will only retain their QSAC status whilst it has QSA's in its employment, which at the moment is me and one other.</p>\n<p>I'm not quite there yet, I've sat the course and met all the other requirements, and yesterday I sat the exam, from which I'll get the results in the next 2 weeks.  I'm also waiting for my police checks to come back.  I'm not expecting any problems (I'll have some explaining to do to my company if I've failed either of them!).</p>\n<p>The course itself was quite interesting.  I was already familiar with a lot of it as I've been working with the standard for the last 2 years but it did help clarify a lot of questions I had over the grey areas in the standard.  I also learnt a few cool tricks such as how to find credit card numbers and a formula that can be applied to discover whether or not a number that you're looking at is in fact a valid credit card number or not.  Quite a nice party trick (for a very geeky party!).</p>\n<p>I'm on a 6-day hacking course in Canberra next week so that knowledge combined with my PCI knowledge should make me a valuable resource for the Russian Mafia. Just kidding!</p>\n",

But now that I'm doing web development work, both at home and at work, I needed something that I could rely on and a machine that wouldn't start dying after having half a dozen windows open.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/5fc13-mac.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f237dd10f.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210580722581422050\" /></a><br />It's also the first time I've used a mac.  After using Windows ever since Windows 3.1 it takes a bit of getting used to because everything is different, but, in most cases I've got to admit it's better on the mac.</p>\n<p>The macbook is expensive but I've managed to a deal with work where I get it through salary sacrifice.  Doing it this way I don't have to pay GST (10%) and it gets paid out of my pre-tax salary, meaning all together a saving of approx 35%. what's more I can pay it over 3 months.  This is the first company I've worked for where they have a policy where you can use your personal laptop as your work laptop (as long as it meets the security requirements) so it works out really well.  They've allowed me to purchase a copy of VMware on expenses which means I can now run a copy of Windows XP in a virtual session on my mac, so I can still use the Microsoft Office applications without having to fork out for a copy of Office 2008 for the Mac.  Funnily enough, Windows now runs faster on my mac with a load of Mac applications open at the same time than it ever did on my last XP laptop.</p>\n<p>Now I'm considering the ultimate accompaniment to my mac - the iPhone 2, which was announced on Monday and is headings it way to Australia on July 11th.  I watched Steve Jobs' keynote speech where he announced the worst kept secret of the year.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>On Wednesday I attended AusCERT 2008.  AusCERT is an annual conference for the IT Security industry organised by the Australian Computer Emergency Response Team.  Held at the plush surroundings of the Crown Plaza Royal Pines Resort on the Gold Coast, the event is a chance for vendors such as Check Point, Microsoft, Symantec, CA, and the likes to show off their wares, and also a chance to hear presentations from industry leaders, as well as get some free training to boot (although it's not free).  Representatives from such luminaries as the US Department of Homeland Security and NSA were also in attendance.</p>\n<p>The event is similar to an annual event I used to attend in the UK - InfoSecurity Europe - which is held at the London Olympia.  Although AusCERT is not nearly the size of InfoSecurity Europe.</p>\n<p>I was pretty disappointed by AusCERT 2008.  I thought I might have made a bad choice with the presentations I attended but after speaking to others the general consensus was that it was pretty crappy all round.  There were a couple of gems in their but mostly it was presenters telling me stuff I already new.  A lot of the presentations were too high-level to be of any value.</p>\n<p>Every year you find that there's a new theme - a new subject which is getting the industry in a flap.  This year it was web 2.0 security.  This is not surprising really with the amount of stories you hear about privacy issues around Facebook, MySpace and other similar social networks that are able to harvest vast amounts of personal data.  I advise everyone to be very careful about what information they put on social networks.  Even if you set up your privacy settings properly it doesn't necessarily mean that your data is safe. </p>\n<p>A combination of factors means that your data could still be at risk.  The look and feel of Facebook is slick because it uses AJAX - a web scripting language for which hackers keep finding new vulnerabilities.  Also, many of the applications that you may add to your Facebook, such as FunWall, aren't built by Facebook, they are built by third parties.  Meaning that these third party applications, that Facebook has little control over, is also accessing your private data and could be doing anything with it, as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/7375772.stm\">this BBC article explains</a>.</p>\n<p>The one presentation that I did find interesting was presented by the Standard Chartered Bank and was an overview of their project to roll-out two-factor authentication for their customers across 15 countries.  I know many banks have been trailing this for a while now but not many banks have actually implemented it due to the cost and administration issues around issuing and managing tokens.  However, this is set to change as they slowly get over the issues; and as the take-up of internet banking continues to increase, so does the risk of internet fraud.</p>\n<p>So if you use internet banking you're probably likely to find that the way you log-on is set to change in the next couple of years.</p>\n<p>Two-factor authentication means that when you use internet banking, instead of just presenting your username and password, and maybe some secondary information like the 1st and 4th character in your PIN (this is all classed as one-factor authentication - something you know), you will also require a second factor of authentication, such as something you have, or less commonly, something you are (biometric identification such as fingerprint, face scan, retina scan, etc).  The most common implementation of two-factor authentication is using a token that creates a One-Time-Password.  The bank would issue you a token which displays a randomly generated number,  This number is usually either generated when you press a button, or it's a number that constantly changes every 60 seconds or so.  By entering the number displayed on the LED screen on your token, you're proving that the person authenticating to internet banking is the person that was issued the  token, i.e. you, or so the theory goes.  Obviously it's not fool-proof, but it does add another level of security to the process.</p>\n<p>Many companies use two-factor authentication for employee remote access to their networks.  One of the big issues with token-based two-factor authentication is the cost of the tokens and the management of them.  This is particularly a problem when you're using it in a business to customer (B2C) environment like a bank, when you may have to issues tokens to 1 or 2 million customers.</p>\n<p>To get around this, another option is to use the customer's mobile phone as the 'something you have' device.  So for instance, when entering internet banking a text message could be sent to your mobile phone with a random number that you would enter into the internet banking login screen.  Alternatively, there's a thing called IVR callback, which basically means that you would receive an automated phone call from your bank which would say something like 'Someone is attempting to log on to your internet banking account, if this is you, press 1'.</p>\n<p>None of these methods are fool-proof - they all have an element of risk.  For instance, when it comes to using mobile phones for two-factor authentication you're then relying on a third party - the telecommunications provider - as part of the process.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the findings from their surveys were quite interesting, as was the story the presenter told about banking fraud in Malaysia. </p>\n<p>Some of the other presentations were dire though.</p>\n<p>One presenter, who was doing a presentation about the security risk management lifecycle, I swear must have based her presentation skills on David Brent in The Office.  At one point, to the amazement of all of us, she actually picked up a bag full of some stupid plastic keys that they were handing out to everyone with their branding on it, and dramatically threw them across the stage.  As they scattered everywhere across the stage she shouted 'You see people, how on earth can you get a grip of your network if you're having to manage that many applications' or something like that.  I was gobsmacked and had to stop myself from laughing out loud.  What did she think she was proving by that display?  Didn't she feel a bit stupid that she now had to go and pick all of those keys up?</p>\n<p>The good points about the day was 1) we got served a really nice meal at lunch time, and 2) I came home with some freebies, although one of these was a Microsoft t-shirt which has the words 'Microsoft: Our Security Rocks' printed on it, which I thought was a bit ironic given the awful reputation of Microsoft's security.</p>\n",

This fascinating book gives a behind the scenes insight into the 9/11 commission's investigation, and provides a context for the well-documented omissions and distortions in the final report that continue to fire the 9/11 conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>The book itself is a gripping read.  Many of the chapters read like a novel; particularly in the first chapter which tells the story of how Sandy Berger, former National Security Advisor to President Clinton, stole classified documents from the National Archives.</p>\n<p>The main point you get from the book is that because of the bi-partisan make-up of the commission, and the determination of the Commission's Republican Chairman and Democrat Vice-Chairman to produce a report that rises above partisan politics and does not assign blame, some of the significant facts found during the investigation, which would certainly have damaged Bush and his top echelon, were merely assigned to footnotes in the final report.</p>\n<p>The chapter that amazed me the most was the one that covered the emergency response to the World Trade Centre attacks in New York and in particular the acts of Rudy Giuliani - the Mayor of New York on Sept 11th 2001.</p>\n<p>If you remember, Rudy Giuliani became a local and national hero after 9/11.  Seen by the public as the great leader who led New York, and America, through the tragedy of 9/11 while George Bush fled to the skies in the safety of Air Force One.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, according to Philip Shenon, Rudy Giuliani's hero status was a fortunate consequence of his own inept actions.  In 1998 Mayor Giuliani was building a forty six thousand square foot Emergency Command Centre  for himself and his senior staff dubbed \"The Bunker\".  The press at the time had a field day lambasting the project, criticising the cost of the construction as an example of Giuliani's oversized ego.  The press also criticised the planned location of \"The Bunker\".  The command centre was going to be built in, of all places, the World Trade Centre complex - the site of a terrorist bombing only 5 years earlier and what was still regarded as top of the list on many terrorist's target lists.  The building would be built in WTC building 7 - directly across from the twin towers.  Not only that, even though it was dubbed \"The Bunker\", the command centre was actually to be situated on the 23rd floor, with panoramic views out to lower Manhattan.</p>\n<p>So as Philip Shennon points out in the book, what was to happen on September 11th was all too predictable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Giuliani never managed to get to the command center in the chaos of the attacks that morning.  By about 9:30am, before either of the twin towers collapsed, everyone in the command center was ordered to evacuate to the street because of fears that more hijacked planes were heading for Manhattan.  The crisis  center was shut down because there was a crisis.  In a final bit of irony, it was determined that a fire that later destroyed WTC 7 on September 11 was probably caused by the rupture of the building's special diesel fuel tanks; the tanks that had been installed to provide emergency power the mayor's command center.</p>\n<p>On September 11, with the command center shut down, Giuliani and his top aides were left with no obvious place to gather away from City Hall.  That left the mayor on the street, resulting in the heroically iconic image of the soot-covered Giuliani leading hundreds of other New Yorkers to safety as he walked north through the gray clouds of debris unleashed by the collapse of the Twin Towers.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>On May 19th 2004, the Commission had the opportunity to tackle Giuliani about this in the commission's public hearing which interviewed Giuliani and the  chiefs of the emergency services.  However, the commissioners wimped out because of what happened the day before.  On the 18th May the commissioners interviewed the chiefs of the emergency services and heavily criticised them for the disastrous crisis plan and mis-management on the day of the attacks.  The overt criticisms galvanised the press and public, as the hearings were being held in New York, to lambast the Commission.  How dare they criticise 'our hero's of 9/11'.  So after the scathing attacks back at them, when it came to interviewing Giuliani in the public hearing on May 19th, instead of criticising Giuliani and challenging him, the Commission heaped praise on him for being a great leader.</p>\n<p>That response on May 19th was evocative of the entire handling of the investigation and the final report; no one was to be assigned blame.</p>\n<p>The area that the book focuses most on though, and the story which I believe has had most criticism since Philip Shenon published this book, is Philip Shenon's portrayal of Philip Zelikow - the Executive Director of the Commission - and his obvious conflicts of interest and his attempts, in Shenon's view, to manipulate the investigation and the final report into avoiding any criticisms of the Bush presidency and his senior staff.</p>\n<p>The conflicts of interest are obvious and according to Shenon, it was due to a lack of proper background checks on Zelikow by the Commission's chairman and vice-chairman, that meant his conflicts of interest were unknown to the commission when they appointed him as Executive Director.  The conflicts of interest were made even more significant due to the way Zelikow ran the investigation.  As much as the 10 commissioner's (5 Republican, 5 Democrat) were the public face of the commission, it was ultimately Zelikow who ran the investigation; deciding who was to be interviewed, what line the investigation would take, and ultimately what was to be included in the final report.</p>\n<p>It comes as no surprise then that the final report lacked any criticism of Bush and particularly, Condoleezza Rice, when you learn that not only was Zelikow a close friend of Condoleeza Rice, but he was also on the transition team when Bush took office in the White House, and was the main contributor the to paper that changed America's National Security Strategy, which for the first time introduced the doctrine of pre-emptive attacks.  These facts are significant and, according to Shennon, help explain why Zekikow:<br /></span></span>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"sans\"><span id=\"btAsinTitle\">Broke the Commission rules and repeatedly telephoned both Rice and Karl Rove, Bush's chief advisor', behind the back of the commission.</span></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"sans\"><span id=\"btAsinTitle\">Attempted to steer the commission into making links between the 9/11 attacks and Saddam Hussein even though there was no evidence to support the links.</span></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"sans\"><span id=\"btAsinTitle\">Managed to shield Rice from  criticism in the final report even though there was clear evidence that, as Bush's National Security Advisor, Rice received clear warnings from the CIA in the months leading up to 9/11 about an imminent attack by Al Qaeda against America, yet did absolutely nothing to act on those warnings.  Including the now famous August 6th PDB (Presidential Daily Briefing) which warned of possible terrorist hijackings of commercial airliners and intelligence that terrorists were carrying out surveillance on buildings in Manhattan.</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"sans\"><span id=\"btAsinTitle\">Other revelations in the book included: the fact that the commission left the investigation of the the NSA's vast archives until the last minute and therefore only managed to read a fraction of the intelligence;  how Dick Cheney, as the Vice-President, gave a shoot-down order on the morning of 9/11 which was unconstitutional (Dick Cheney claims that he was acting on behalf of Bush but there was no evidence to corroborate Cheney's assertion); and how the final report failed to fully emphasise the abysmal failings of the FBI largely because the new FBI Director managed to schmooze the commissioners into believing that he could change the FBI for the better and there was no reason to break it up, which was certainly in the minds of the commissioners when they first learned of the FBI's bumblings.</p>\n<p>All in all the book is a fascinating read and I highly recommend it if, like me, you're intrigued by everything surrounding 9/11.</span></span><span class=\"sans\"><span id=\"btAsinTitle\"></p>\n<p></span></span></p>\n",

The time flew by but they definitely made the most of their first visit to Australia.</p>\n<p>With the exception of Sydney most of their time was spent with us - I certainly haven't got much leave left to take from work for the rest of this year! While they were here they enjoyed trips to the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast; they had a couple of days in Sydney; they saw a lot of Brisbane and the surrounding area, including Redcliffe, South Bank, the CBD, Mount Coot-tha, and North Stradbroke Island; they took in Sea World, Australia Zoo, and Phantom of the Opera; and not forgetting the week in <a href=\"http://darylandrach.blogspot.com/2008/04/palm-cove.html\">Palm Cove</a>.  We also enjoyed many a nice meal out, and got through enough bottles of Aussie wine to launch an Armada, and played countless games of Uno Attack, and Monopoly, and Trivial Pursuit.</p>\n<p>In the most part the weather was fantastic for them - certainly better than the two times that we came before emigrating here.  I think it's fair to say a good time was had by all.</p>\n<p>The last full day that I spent with them was when I took them over to North Stradbroke Island (Straddie).  If there's one place that shows off Australia at its best, Straddie is that place.  This view is only an hour away from my house, and that includes a drive to the ferry, a ferry across to the island, and then a bus to Point Lookout...</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2252/2438517070_85d9d3a451_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2252/2438517070_85d9d3a451_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/2438637348_5cd48a2595_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/2438637348_5cd48a2595_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>Throughout their visit, most importantly we all had a laugh, particularly at my Dad's efforts with his video camera.</p>\n<p>I copied some of his video footage to cheer me up when I'm having a bad day.

The apartment was the best we've ever stayed in and I'd definitely stay their again if we re-visit Palm Cove.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2179/2414783727_a123095533_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2179/2414783727_a123095533_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>Palm Cove itself is a beautiful little resort set against the long curving Palm Cove Beach with a backdrop of rainforest covered mountains.  The Palm Cove promenade is lined with 500-year-old Melaleuca trees and all the hotels and apartments are set low so that out at sea, and even on the Pier at the northern end of Palm Cove, the resort is completely hidden from view.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2417624902_3022c83d49_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2417624902_3022c83d49_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2036/2417627234_26067c47bd_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2036/2417627234_26067c47bd_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cairns Night Zoo</span></p>\n<p>On the second night in Palm Cove we went to <a href=\"http://www.cairnsnightzoo.com/\">Cairns Night Zoo</a>, which is only 5 minutes away from Palm Cove.  Visiting a zoo at night is a completely different experience to the day, and only being a small zoo, Cairns Night Zoo go out of their way to make it a memorable, hands-on experience.</p>\n<p>When we got there we were welcomed into the restaurant where we were treated to a traditional Aussie BBQ and a FREE BAR.  I could have quite happily stayed at the free bar all night but in the end I'm glad I continued to the tour as it was quite an experience.</p>\n<p>There was only a small group of us.  We were all given a torch and followed a guide around while he took us around the main attractions.  This being Tropical Far Northern Queensland, most of the attractions were things that can easily kill you!</p>\n<p>It started off quite tamely with birds of prey swooping over our heads (it was that close that if I was wearing a wig it would surely have come off).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3045/2414822037_4650705fdb_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3045/2414822037_4650705fdb_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the guides seemed to spend the entire evening covered in Possum piss...</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/2415644066_8b8004f0ea_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/2415644066_8b8004f0ea_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>And of course, you can't go to a zoo in Australia and not stroke a Koala...</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2036/2414841519_73217d8c41_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2036/2414841519_73217d8c41_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>There was a fair share of the nasty stuff though, including Crocodiles, Snakes and the pest which is the Cane Toad.  I had to laugh when my Mum was stroking the Cane Toad thinking it was just a normal toad, completely oblivious to the fact that the toad's paratoid glands contains venom that if exposed to could inflict cardiac arrest and kill you within 15 minutes!

It really was a perfect evening.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Great Barrier Reef</span></p>\n<p>The highlight of the holiday though for me was the trip out to the reef where I had my first go at SCUBA diving.</p>\n<p>We booked the excursion with QuickSilver, who picked us up by coach from our apartments, drove the scenic ocean highway up to Port Douglas, and then transferred us to their huge Catamaran which took us out to their diving platform on the Agincourt Reef, which is in the Outer Barrier Reef.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.quicksilver-cruises.com/images/frontpage/outer-reef-platform.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.quicksilver-cruises.com/images/frontpage/outer-reef-platform.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:200px;\" /></a><span style=\"font-size:78%;\">Photo courtesy of QuickSilver<br /></span>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"></p>\n<p>I did an introductory SCUBA dive.  It only lasted about 30 minutes but it was a fantastic experience and something I hope to repeat.  In fact, I'm now hooked and have added PADI certification to my to-do list.</p>\n<p>I hired an underwater camera but of course the pics you take yourself of the reef can never look the same as what you see in the brochures, unless of course you've got all the professional gear and lighting equipment, and have gone to the right reef at the right time of day.  Apparently the reef photographers sometimes spend weeks underwater just waiting for the right conditions to get the perfect shot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3256/2416932521_0e9e46d963_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3256/2416932521_0e9e46d963_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>The experience of swimming with the fishes (not in the Godfather way) and touching the coral was truly amazing.  As everything is alive down there whatever you feel immediately responds to your touch, and every bit of coral has a different texture.</p>\n<p>I put my hand in this thing and it gently closed up to my touch...</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3213/2416909873_6eb88e1980_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3213/2416909873_6eb88e1980_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>We also all got the chance to snorkel on the reef, and the revelation for me was Lauren.  When I had tried to get her to wear a snorkel and mask in the pool in preparation for the trip, she wouldn't entertain it.  However, out on the reef in fairly choppy water she was like a fish to water, figuratively speaking.</p>\n<p>By the end I was having trouble keeping up with her.  She had a perfect technique with the flippers and kept shooting out all over the place and wasn't bothered in the slightest by all the fish swimming around her.  I've got high hopes for her - she's going to be an amazing swimmer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3206/2414935779_60235f57df_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3206/2414935779_60235f57df_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3296/2417759462_815335b45b_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3296/2417759462_815335b45b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rainforests</span></p>\n<p>Another truly remarkable day-trip was the SkyRail and Scenic Railway trip through and over Queensland's World Heritage listed Tropical Rainforest.  Stretching for over 500 kilometres along Tropical North Queensland‚Äôs coastline, the rainforests are the oldest continually surviving rainforests on earth and once covered the entire Australian continent.</p>\n<p>The day started with a 90-minute train ride on the historic <a href=\"http://www.kurandascenicrailway.com.au/\">Kuranda Scenic Railway</a>.  Built between 1882 and 1891, the railway is a remarkable feat of engineering.  Built by hand, the railway winds for 75.1km through dense rainforest, rises to an altitude of 327.1m  and includes 15 tunnels, 93 curves and dozens of difficult bridges mounted many meters above ravines and waterfalls.  The railway cost the lives of many of the brave men who worked on it. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2416/2414962143_37924e36cf_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2416/2414962143_37924e36cf_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>On the way up to Kuranda we had a brief photo stop at Baron Falls...</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2335/2415799436_c7f2cd30ea_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2335/2415799436_c7f2cd30ea_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a></p>\n<p>Kuranda itself is a picturesque mountain village in the rainforests, with many attractions, historic buildings, upmarket restaurants and coffee shops.

Unfortunately I don't think they publicised it very well or thought through the impact, as a lot of computer software that was set to automatically adjust the time was not amended to reflect the change.  I saw the result first hand when I went to the client site on Monday morning.</p>\n<p>Microsoft quickly released a patch to fix the clock on Windows.  However, the patch didn't extend to the Calendar in Microsoft Outlook - so everyone's appointments and meetings were out by an hour.</p>\n<p>Apparently even many mobile phones were affected, and phone services, including the Telstra speaking clock.  It comes to something when the phone company's speaking clock is an hour wrong!</p>\n<p>We don't have such problems in Queensland as the Queensland State Government has so far refused to adopt daylight saving hours.  A backwards and stupid decision if you ask me.

				"content_text": "<p>A landing time of 6:50am meant it was an early start on Sunday to ensure we were there to meet my parents at Brisbane airport.  It was great to see them emerge through the arrivals tunnel  after not seeing them for 10 months.  My mum burst into tears, bless her, and Lauren was very excited to see her Grandma and Grandad.  The excitement increased when she discovered they were bearing presents!</p>\n<p>My Dad was sporting what looked like a very sore (red) head.  He'd got himself sunburnt in Singapore.  He'll never learn.</p>\n<p>Luckily, after a long period of mediocre weather, Sunday was glorious for their arrival.  It was about 27 degrees and barely a cloud in the sky.</p>\n<p>I was expecting that they'd want to get their heads down when they got back to our house after a night flight from Singapore, but they instead decided to stay up and see the day through.  I've always gone straight to bed after a night flight - I can't function when I'm tired. They're obviously made of sterner stuff than I am.  Maybe I was adopted?</p>\n<p>Later Sunday morning we took them out to see a bit of Brisbane.  We drove to Bulimba and got the CityCat down the Brisbane River to South Bank Parklands.  We showed them around South Bank and had a really nice pub lunch.</p>\n<p>We got back to our house about 3:30pm, which we decided was a good time to take a swim in the pool.  This time of year (Autumn here) the pool spends much of the time in the shade and as it's much cooler in the evenings it doesn't stay particularly warm during the day.  You could say the water is 'refreshing'.  That would be one way of describing it.  Anyway we all braved it with the exception of Rach who I don't think I'll get in their again until Summer.  Nesh!  It's actually alright once you get in, honest!</p>\n<p>After a swim we all played Uno Attack and had a few glasses of wine before it was time for me to depart to Brisbane airport yet again for my flight to Sydney, which is where I am now.</p>\n<p>I believe my parents are in Mooloolaba now on the Sunshine Coast (1.5 hours north of Brisbane).  Yesterday they spent the day at Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast (1 hour north of Brisbane).  So they're definitely making the most of their holiday.</p>\n<p>I'm flying back to Brisbane mid-afternoon tomorrow so I'm back into time for us all to go out tomorrow night.  We're going to see Phantom of the Opera.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The last few weeks have been work, work, work unfortunately, hence the lack of blog posts.  However, there's light at the end of the tunnel - this weekend sees the arrival of my parents for their first visit to Oz, and I've made sure to arrange plenty of leave so I can get back into holiday mode again.  In fact, we're all off up to Palm Cove in Far Northern Queensland to spend a week on the Great Barrier Reef.  Before that though, I've got to make yet another trip to Sydney.  The bummer about this Sydney trip is that I've got to go on the day my parents arrive.  They arrive Sunday morning and I fly to Sydney on Sunday evening, coming back Thursday. </p>\n<p>The reason I've been so busy is due to a combination of factors that have coincided.  On the work front we had a major turnover in staff, leaving me as the only member of the Security Compliance team.  So as well as having to juggle existing client work I was the only one available to take on new client work.  It didn't help that my main existing client work has been at a critical point in the assignment meaning they needed a lot of attention.</p>\n<p>Adding to that, the first of the two website that I'm having developed in India, which <a href=\"http://darylandrach.blogspot.com/2007/09/hello-again.html\">I previously wrote about here</a>, has finally been handed over to me, which means it's now all on me to get the site ready for go-live.  Due to a number of factors, of which I'm not going to go into now but suffice to say things didn't go exactly to plan with the web development company we used (that's an whole other blog post), there's still a lot of work to be done before the site can be launched.  The current plan is that go-live will be sometime in June/July and I'm doing all I can to meet these dates, if not sooner.</p>\n<p>Thank god I managed to wangle a 4-day work week.  They're sure getting their money's worth out of me during the 4-days.  With all the work they've put on to me it means I've been having to work during the evenings to keep on top of it - time I would have otherwise spent on the business.  At least I've managed to draw a line and not let it run into my weekend time.  That 3-day weekend is sacrosanct and has meant I've managed to make some good progress on the website - mainly reverse engineering what the dodgy web developers have done so I can improve it. </p>\n<p>It's a slow process but I'm getting there.  This time next year we'll be mill... we'll maybe the year after!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>We moved into new offices today at work.  The company I'm working for as outgrown our previous office so had to look for new premises.  The problem is, because of a rise in rental prices the company could no longer afford the lovely CBD (Central Business District) location for the office capacity that we now need.  So we're now moved to Fortitude Valley. </p>\n<p>I now have to get the train to Brunswick St station for work.  The train service is pretty good, it's not overcrowded (I was able to get a seat easy enough this morning), and the commute time is roughly the same time as before.  The problem is, Fortitude Valley is not one of the nicest places.  When I leave Brunswick St Station to walk to the office I now pass sex shops, peep shows, strip clubs, druggies and drunken aboriginals sitting on the street corner yelling abuse at everyone who passes.   There's a lingering stench of marijuana on the streets and you get the sense that you could be mugged at any moment.  I'm sure I'll get used to it.  At night I've been told Fortitude Valley (or The Valley as it's known to locals) is one of the best places in the city for nightlife, which isn't much of a consolation.</p>\n<p>I've just been out for lunch to explore the area.  I was nice and settled at our previous location but now I need to find new places to eat / withdraw cash / get my haircut / etc.</p>\n<p>That's the moan over with.  On the positive side the actual offices are much nicer with lots more space than we had previously.  Plus my desk is positioned quite well so that I can at least have some privacy now.</p>\n<p>As work goes I've just passed a major hurdle.  The first Australian client that I'm taking through ISO 27001 certification has breezed through the stage 1 audit.  So everyone is pleased with the work I did.  I've been in Sydney every week for the past month but I've got a break now - I don't need to go back until the 18th March, in preparation for the Stage 2 audit which will hopefully result in a certificate.  The break from traveling is greatly appreciated.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>After two years of battle between Sony's Blueray and Toshiba's HD-DVD technology, the High Definition format war is finally over.</p>\n<p>Now that all 6 major movie studios have backed Blueray, Toshiba has been left with no choice but to discontinue production of the HD-DVD disks.  As with the previous format wars (between Betamax and VHS) this is likely to be held up as a case study in business and marketing courses for years to come.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">VHS vs Betamax</span></p>\n<p>It seems Sony has learnt a thing or two from the defeat of their Betamax format.  I remember finding the VHS/Betamax format war fascinating when I studied it in an Open University course I took a few years ago. </p>\n<p>Many factors played a part in the final dominance of VHS, but arguably the main reason for the victory was simply because in the early years, Betamax could only record for 1 hour and VHS could record for 2.  Sony failed to do proper market research and wrongly believed that customers would prefer to go for the technically superior Betamax.  Sony were also slow to licence their technology to other manufacturers.  By the time Sony realised what was happening and reacted to market conditions, it was already too late.</p>\n<p>VHS dominated the market by a) producing what the consumer wanted - a cassette capable of recording a full film, and b) enabling large scale production of cheap VHS players. </p>\n<p>The Thorn-EMI group backed VHS and flooded their many high-street TV rental shops with low-cost VHS machines.  Alternatively, Sony were concentrating on quality, so Betamax became a format to buy while VHS was the format to rent.   Unfortunately for Sony, most people preferred to rent at the time, particularly when the simplest machine cost around ¬£700 (equivalent to over ¬£2000 today). This process was then self-reinforcing, because the presence of two formats made people reluctant to commit to one and risk picking the eventual loser - and so they rented and waited to see what would happen. By 1980, out of an estimated 100,000 homes with VCRs, 70% were rented.</p>\n<p>Then came the explosion in the early 80's of video tape rental - another factor that led to the demise of Betamax.  The Betamax suppliers were slow off the mark, and released less films on the format. As more people bought or rented video players and started to rent tapes, the greater choice was with VHS, which reinforced the reason for customers to purchase VHS players rather than Betamax.</p>\n<p>And that was the end of Betamax, with the exception of Japan where the standard remained popular.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Was it Worth It?</p>\n<p></span>Sony has won the HD-DVD battle and people will argue about how they did it for years to come.  It wasn't as straight forward as the VHS/Betamax battle.  What were the real reasons for the movie studios backing Blueray instead of HD-DVD?  The fact that Sony Pictures is one of the major movie studios probably had something to do with it.</p>\n<p>The question you've got to ask though, is how relevant is Blueray given the move to downloadable content from the Internet.  Itunes, Amazon, Lovefilm and many others are now already offering downloadable movies.  High volume disk storage is becoming ridiculously cheap; internet bandwidth is increasing at a tremendous rate; and most DVD players now come with many options, including DIVX - the format of choice for peer-to-peer downloaded content.</p>\n<p>Seriously, on-demand video is now a reality.  In a few years time the average home will get most of their TV and video content delivered by the Internet, and if we want to store and keep it, we'll save it on a hard drive (or maybe even flash drive).  The Writers Guild of America know this, which is one of the reasons for the recent Hollywood writers strike, which ended with the movie studios finally agreeing to pay residuals for online content.</p>\n<p>I'm holding out on Blueray for this very reason, unless of course I can talk Rach into agreeing to get a PS3 which comes with a Blueray player.  But given we've already got a Wii I don't think that will be an option.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've just returned from watching Rambo at our local flicks.</p>\n<p>Growing up with the Rambo films I was looking forward to seeing this final revisit, particularly after seeing, and enjoying, Rocky Balboa, Sly's other throw back to the eighties.</p>\n<p>Whereas Rocky Balboa worked well as mainly a character drama; taking a nostalgic trip down memory lane yet at the same time re-generating the excitement of the early Rocky franchise; disappointingly, I found Rambo to be just an over-the-top gore fest with absolutely nothing interesting to say.</p>\n<p>Like Rocky Balboa, this film did have a flash-back sequence to try and help explain why Rambo is who he is and why he hasn't returned to America.  But any attempt to delve into the character of John Rambo was entirely superficial. </p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane.  You know what you're going to get when you see a Rambo film.  However, if I hadn't have already known that Sly himself had directed this I may have thought that Quentin Tarantino had got his hands on the film, such was the level of sad-masochistic violence.  Was there really any need for the camera to linger on scenes of beheadings and mutilation?  Funnily enough, I've just had a look on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462499/\">IMDB.com</a> and it actually says if you liked this film you may also enjoy Kill Bill: Vol 1.</p>\n<p>The main thing you expect to see in a Rambo film is Rambo himself killing lots of baddies in a hundred different inventive ways - utilising his special forces training.  While the body count that he racks up his large, a good proportion of this is down to him spraying the baddies with a large calibre machine gun.  Boring! I was hoping to see a lot more hand-to-hand combat and the use of special techniques.</p>\n<p>At 91 minutes the film is short.  Even though I didn't particularly enjoy it I did feel the film was missing a good 30 minutes of plot.  Everything seemed really rushed.  When the final credits came up it was a case of 'is that it?'.</p>\n<p>If you want to see Rambo my advice is don't.  Rent out Tears of the Sun with Bruce Willis instead.  It's basically the same film except Tears of the Sun is much better.</p>\n",

Being previously used to a 5 minute cut and quick brush down (which always seemed to leave more hair down the back of my shirt than what went on the floor), the first time I got my hair cut in Australia I was pleasantly surprised when on completion of the cut I was treated to a neck shave with cut-throat blade, followed by a hot towel on my face and neck, a head massage, and finally a small hoover device to clean away any residual hair.  As this was a lunchtime haircut I think it was the first time in my life that I'd gone back to work after lunch feeling clean and refreshed.  All of this for $22 (roughly ten British pounds). </p>\n<p>I've since returned to the barbers in question many times.

We haven't been doing much lately as we're saving our money for when my parents come over at the end of March for 4 weeks, in which time we're planning on a week up on the Great Barrier Reef.</p>\n<p>Besides that, the weather here is still crap.  The locals are describing it as one of the best summers in years - mild with loads of rain.  This may seem strange to us poms but knowing how hot it can get here in the summer I can understand the appreciation of a reprieve.  The combined dam levels are currently at a whopping 37%, and if they reach 40% there is talk of a lowering of the water restrictions.  A couple of weeks ago we had 110mm of rain in less than an hour, resulting in large areas of flooding and even one death - a local teenager tried to surf the flash flood and got his ankle stuck in a drain and subsequently drowned.  Apparently it's going to get really hot again in March and we're in for a mild Winter.  It only usually gets as low as 18 degrees C here during the day in the Winter anyway so I'm not sure what they mean by mild!</p>\n<p>If I'm not depressed enough by the rain then I can always count on my beloved Liverpool FC to depress me even more.  What the hell is going on with that team?  How can we get knocked out of the FA Cup by Barnsley?  The Rafalution is well and truly over.  Benitez, you have to go.</p>\n<p>On the work front I'm back and forth to Sydney every week at the moment.  I don't mind it so much though because I'm clocking up loads of air miles!  In fact, I'm trying to get much savvier with my finances.  I always fly with Virgin Blue for which I get velocity points (air miles).  And to add to this I've now got a credit card for which I get velocity points on purchases.  So I now use the credit card for all purchases and set the balance to be paid off in full each month.  The NAB (National Australia Bank) credit card comes with two credit cards on the same account - 1 Visa and 1 American Express - and I get double the points if I use the American Express.</p>\n<p>It's working out pretty well because using the BPAY system in Australia I can pay most of my household bills using the credit card as well.  I've set the maximum balance of the credit card to be roughly the same as my monthly income to counter the risk of not being able to pay off the monthly balance.  At the moment I've earned enough velocity points to buy half a tennis racket.  So if all goes well I should be able to clock up enough air miles to make it back to the UK roughly some time in 2025!</p>\n",

I decided to stay in a serviced apartment again this time (as I did the week before xmas), however  it‚Äôs a pleasure to discover that these Meriton apartments are much nicer, more conveniently located, yet roughly the same price as the Medina Executive Apartments I stayed in last time.   It‚Äôs only a studio apartment but it‚Äôs twice the size of the one I stayed in at the Medina. </p>\n<p>It was a bit of a nightmare getting here though.  It started when I did the web check-in before I flew.  I didn‚Äôt realize until I got to the airport but the boarding pass that I printed off had bumped me to a slightly later flight.  And then when I reached the airport, I couldn‚Äôt find the flight on the departure boards.  The Virgin Blue desk then informed me that the flight that I‚Äôd been bumped to had been cancelled, so I was bumped again to a later flight.  Finally when I was in the air, the flight itself suffered from a lot of turbulence. At one point it seemed to drop out of the air for 3 seconds, which briefly left my stomach in my throat, and the landing was one of the heaviest I‚Äôve ever experienced.  We bounced so hard I thought we were going to bounce completely off the runway!  To top it off, when we arrived at the arrival gate, somehow, the air bridge connecting the terminal gate to the airplane became stuck to the aircraft in the wrong position and it took 20 minutes for them to disengage and realign it properly before we could disembark.  What a nightmare.</p>\n<p>Sydney is having the same weather has Brisbane by the looks of it.  Warm but very wet.  It amazes me to see the amount of people walking about in flip-flops, or ‚Äòthongs‚Äô as they call them over here,  even though it‚Äôs been raining pretty much non-stop for the last week.  Aren‚Äôt they worried about trench foot?</p>\n<p>One consequence of all this rain we‚Äôre having is that it seems to result in a lot of insects trying to take shelter in our house.  Last week the largest spider I have ever seen in my life outside of a zoo scuttled across our living room floor and frightened the life out of us.  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt think I had a  phobia of spiders until I saw that thing.  I quickly went to get a glass to put it out before realising that we didn‚Äôt possess a glass big enough.  I then tried a Tupperware box but I couldn‚Äôt catch it, it was too fast for me.  I suggested to Rach that we just splatter it but she was having none of it.  Not because she didn‚Äôt want to harm it.  She was worried about the mess it would make, which was fair enough because it would have been a large splatter!  In the end I ended up using the hoover attachment to suck it up.  How the hell do they get in that‚Äôs what I want to know.  We‚Äôre supposed to have full mesh screening on all windows and doors to stop even the smallest mosquito.  They‚Äôre sneaky little critters!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On Saturday it was Australia Day which meant yesterday (Monday) was a public holiday.  The net result was a fantastic 4-day weekend for me!</p>\n<p>We decided to partake in Australia Day celebrations by visiting South Bank.  Before that however, we took a train into the city and had a walk up Queen St Mall.  Queen St Mall is an open air shopping arcade and pretty much the centre of Brisbane.  Like many other cities, as a central pedestrian area there's always the odd sideshow (or freak show), busker and human statue to entertain the passing public.  Surprisingly, Queen St Mall was the quietest I've ever seen it.  Whenever I'm there during my lunch break at work it's always heaving with people.  It's really strange to find a city centre shopping area that's busier during the week than at the weekends.  Maybe most people had sense and decided to head to the beach for Australia Day?</p>\n<p>After getting some lunch in the Myer Centre (after finally deciding what to have from the endless selection of food outlets in the food court) we walked over the Victoria Bridge to South Bank.</p>\n<p>South Bank is always a hub of activity when there's public events to celebrate and Saturday was no exception.   However, having seen most of the stuff before (it seems like Brisbane is celebrating something nearly every weekend) we headed to the newly refurbished lagoons to cool off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2335/2227265920_dcdb21d26c_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2335/2227265920_dcdb21d26c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />More photo's on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/\">flickr</a>.</p>\n<p>The beach in the city should be a must for all cities I reckon.  It would be nice to work that side of the river, with the option of taking a dip during lunch or straight after work.  A large section of the lagoons is pretty deep (out of my depth anyway, which is not hard) so good for swimming.  It was hard getting Lauren out when it was time to head back home.</p>\n<p>We could have hung around for the obligatory fireworks but instead we headed home and went next door for a BBQ and a few glasses of vino.</p>\n<p>On Sunday we thought we'd try out another beach.  This time we headed down to Mermaid Beach on the Gold Coast, which is south of Surfer's Paradise.  As soon as we arrived though we realised that we should have checked the conditions before we left.  There was heavy wind on the beach, which was weird because as soon as you walked off the beach the wind died to a light breeze.  The ocean was pretty rough too.</p>\n<p>Not wishing to miss an opportunity I braved the conditions and went in to jump a few waves.  I didn't last long.  The ocean was lovely and warm but the continuous rush of fast incoming waves made it dangerous to venture in too far.  Similarly, there was a strong under-current (rip) that was pushing northwards.  I reckon if I'd have picked my feet up for too long I would have been at Surfer's Paradise within a matter of minutes!</p>\n<p>Conditions weren't much easier lying on the beach.  The wind was picking up the fine white sand and blasting it against our skin.  You have to be a committed beach God/Queen to put up with that level of discomfort.  We soon left the beach and headed back home.  The elements had beaten us so we retired to the comfort of the complex swimming pool.</p>\n<p>On Monday we did have plans to go to an expats meetup at a British pub in the city.  It was such a lovely hot day however that we couldn't bring ourselves to spend the afternoon in a pub.  Instead, a good few trips were made between the sun longer, pool and beer fridge.  Particularly as it was touching 34 degrees inside the house!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2211/2225054171_f6d021c4f2_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2211/2225054171_f6d021c4f2_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:320px;\" /></a><br />The weekend wasn't all play though, I did manage to get a few hours in on Monday working on my business (mainly trying to coerce developers in India to actually do the work I'm paying them for!).</p>\n",

				"title": "Reported UK Data Losses - It's Worse Than You Think",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>It comes as no surprise to me that we're seeing a lot of news reports lately regarding lost or stolen government laptops and removable media containing personal information. In the last week alone we've seen <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7197045.stm\">records of 600,00 people have been lost by the Royal Navy</a>, as well as the <a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2008/01/18/228990/stockport-primary-care-trust-loses-4000-patient-records-on-memory.htm\">loss of 4000 patient records by Stockport Primary Care Trust</a>.</p>\n<p>The truth is, this has been happening for years and the incidents that are being reported to the press are probably only a fraction of the actual incidents. In the UK there are no legal requirements for government departments or companies to publicly disclose data losses, so you have to draw the conclusion that the only reason why the Government is being upfront about losses at the moment is because they know this is an hot issue in the press and if they didn't offer full disclose it would probably be leaked anyway.</p>\n<p>I was watching the news yesterday when David Milliband, the Foreign Secretary, made the remark that we cannot legislate against people having their laptops stolen from cars. That's all very well but he's missing the point entirely. You can't legislate against laptop theft but you can legislate against how data is stored and protected in the first place.</p>\n<p>Another investigation on its own isn't going to stop this from happening again. As an Information Security Consultant who has worked with both local and central government, I've seen at first hand the systems and processes that are in place governing data protection, or rather lack of them. Unless there's a fundamental change to the approach to security within the Government this type of incident will occur again and again.</p>\n<p>Based on my own experiences, there are a number of problems with current arrangements that make these incidents likely, including a lack of clearly defined legislation governing data security, insufficient independent regulatory oversight of security in government departments, and a lack of due diligence and contracts management when it comes to outsourcing services to the private sector.</p>\n<p>For what it's worth, here's my two pennies worth of how I believe these issues could be resolved:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1. New legislation needs to be passed mandating strict standards for government systems</span></p>\n<p>The Data Protection Act is not specific enough when it comes to requirements, and can be interpreted in a number of ways. That's why the Information Commissioner has such an hard job with enforcing the requirements and issuing penalties when things go wrong. The DPA has eight principles, one of which specifically addresses data security - Principle 7:</p>\n<blockquote><p>'Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.'</p></blockquote>\n<p>The key word here is 'appropriate'. Appropriate is subjective. The interpretation of Principle 7 in the Act itself doesn't particularly help either because it uses words such as 'reasonable measures'. In guidelines produced by the Information Commissioner supporting the Data Protection Act reference is made to more specific security requirements, but it can be argued that there is nothing on the Statute book that specifies the exact minimum requirements for protecting personal data. Similarly the Act does not properly reflect new technologies and new threats.</p>\n<p>The government could address this by first updating the Data Protection Act to strengthen requirements which I believe it is already planning, but also implement new legislation that specifically addresses security standards for Government held data. This should be something similar to the US Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). FISMA is a comprehensive framework that has strict requirements for all federal agencies. The UK legislation would need to make it clear that government departments are required by law to implement the requirements of the HMG Manual of Protective Security, HMG Information Security Standards, as well as the recently published Information Assurance Policy. Whilst the MPS and security standards have been around for a while now, the continuation of these types of security breaches just goes to show that they are not being properly implemented or enforced.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2. The CSIA and CESG should be given a larger budget and more powers</span></p>\n<p>In 2003, the <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/csia.aspx\">Central Sponsor for Information Assurance (CSIA)</a> was established in the Cabinet Office with responsibilities for providing strategic direction in information assurance across all government departments, guided by a National Strategy for Information Assurance.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cesg.gov.uk/\">Computer Electronics Support Group (CESG)</a> is the Information Assurance arm of <a href=\"http://www.gchq.gov.uk/\">GCHQ </a>(GCHQ is responsible for electronic surveillance, similar to the NSA in the US) and acts as the National Technical Authority for the UK Government, similar to the <a href=\"http://csrc.nist.gov/\">National Institute for Standards (NIST)</a> in the US. However, if you look at the output of the CESG and need for the CESG to rely on private sector specialists to carry out work on their behalf (through the <a href=\"http://www.cesg.gov.uk/site/clas/index.cfm\">CLAS scheme</a>), it's clear that they have a long way to go before their standards become as clear or prolific as NIST, or they have the ability address Government security in a way that NIST is doing through the FISMA Implementation Programme.</p>\n<p>As for the CLAS programme, even though HMG Security Standards specify that that IT projects should go through formal security accreditation by a CLAS consultant, many don't.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that both CSIA and CESG don't have the budget or resources to properly fulfil their obligations, because if they did, we wouldn't keep having to read about data losses. If the CSIA and/or CLAS had the powers and resources to carry out regular, in-depth audits of all government departments and carry out full security accreditation and certification then issues such as poor data handling procedures and lack of encryption on laptops and backup tapes would be picked up and addressed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">3. Government departments should be given a dedicate Information Security budget</span></p>\n<p>This may have changed now but from what I've seen IT security expenditure is usually taken out of the general IT budget. Companies that have good security generally ring-fence approx 15-20% of their IT budget specifically for security. Government departments should do the same.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">4. Government departments should be subjected to more stringent regulatory oversight</span></p>\n<p>When the <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/Library/Communication/PR/2007/021.shtml\">Nationwide Building Society was fined ¬£1 million by the Financial Services Authority (FSA)</a> after a laptop was stolen containing thousands of customer's banking details, this was enough of a wake-up call to other banks to finally implement the end-device security programmes that their security departments had been recommending. A good proportion of the banks are now using technology such as that provided by the likes of <a href=\"http://www.checkpoint.com/products/datasecurity/pc/\">PointSec </a>and <a href=\"http://www.safeboot.com/\">Safeboot </a>to lock down laptops and encrypt the hard drives. I personally use <a href=\"http://www.truecrypt.org/\">TrueCrypt </a>on my home laptop which is open source (free).</p>\n<p>Government departments should be subject to similar compliance penalties. Now I'm not one who particularly believes that financial penalties for public sector bodies is the right way to go. After all, it's tax payers money that pays the penalty and it's tax payers, not company directors or shareholders as with a PLC, who ultimately lose out because there's less money to put into government services. However, it's clear that the current situation, where the Government suffers some embarrassment and a Civil Servant is forced to hand in his resignation (sometimes, not always), is not enough of a penalty. This is a tricky one, because if the penalties are severe then the departments concerned will be less likely to publicly disclose the incident in the first place.</p>\n<p>How about this: what if (1) a law was introduced similar to the <a href=\"http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/SecurityBreach.htm\">California Security Breach Notification Law</a> making it compulsory to publicly disclose security incidents that impact personal data, and (2) senior management and ministers are made directly accountable for any security breaches. Depending upon the severity of the incident the Civil Servant up to the Minister and finally the Secretary of State will be forced to resign (completely from Government, not just shuffled to another post) and/or personally fined. That could work?</p>\n<p>By the way, I believe strongly that a security breach notification law should be introduced that also applies to all companies. I've seen many a security breach that has been completely covered up internally and not even reported to the authorities through fear of damage to reputation and contractual penalties.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">5. Improve due diligence and contracts management for outsourced contracts</span></p>\n<p>The scary thing is that large parts of government services have been outsourced to the private sector, and many of these private sector companies have not made the investment in security that you would expect when we're talking about the protection of government systems and government held data.</p>\n<p>I've seen at first-hand how companies bid for government contracts, promise the world in the bid so that they'll win the contract, and then fail to deliver what they've promised and get away with it because the Government doesn't carry out sufficient due diligence before awarding the contract, or in-depth audits for the duration of the contracts.</p>\n<p>The likes of EDS and Capita have large multi-million pound contracts to manage a huge proportion of government IT systems and services. Some of these contracts run for 10 years and were written at a time when security wasn't the issue it was today. Even the contracts that are written today don't go far enough to mandate security requirements. The contracts that I've seen have some reference to the Manual of Protective Security and usually state that providers should 'demonstrate compliance with' ISO 27001 - the international best practice standard for Information Security Management. However, there's a big difference between compliance and certification.</p>\n<p>ISO 27001 certification should be a minimum requirement, at least this would demonstrate that the company has a formal security risk management and governance framework in place, and this has been independantly verified by an external auditor. However, even this does not go far enough. I help companies achieve ISO 27001 certification and I know how easy it is to get certified by simply choosing the right auditor (there's a massive difference between success criteria from one auditor to the next) and producing documentation that looks the part but does not necessarily reflect reality. Government contracts should specify in detail the exact security requirements. Instead of having security specifications which have ambiguous statements like 'Data should be protected according to risk' they should say, for example, 'data held on backup media must be encrypted, and as a minimum AES encryption with a bit-strength of 256 must be used'. This would make it clear to service providers that investment in technology such as data encryption is not optional.</p>\n<p>As for due diligence, what tends to happen in my experience is that bidding companies are asked to provide copies of company security policies and standards. This is not good enough. Just because the security policy stipulates that a certain level of security is required that doesn't mean that it's standard practice for the company to implement it. No, there needs to be thorough due-diligence which includes in-depth investigation, inspection of systems and processes, and even visits to reference sites.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, once the contract is awarded, it's not good enough, as is usually the case at the moment, to simply send out an annual security questionnaire to the service provider. Again, just because someone puts some good sounding words in a completed security questionnaire it doesn't mean that those answers reflect reality. There needs to be regular, full, independent audits of all aspects of the IT environment and services being provided.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I've said my piece. How are we supposed to have trust that the UK national ID card programme will securely hold our biometric identifier, an identifier that we can't revoke or change, or that the NHS Spine, which has been contracted out to BT, will securely hold all our health records? You may think so what if someone gets hold of my personal information, they can't do anything with it. Think again. The risk of identity theft should not be underestimated. Identity theft is said to be the fasting growing crime and with a few pieces of personal information it's possible for a fraudster to take over your entire life - access your bank account, get your mail redirected, get identity documents such as passports and driving licences issued to them in your name with their photo. There's many documented incidents that prove this is happening all the time.</p>\n<p>I worry because my details are on UK <em>and</em> Australia government systems!</p>\n<p>When I read about the loss of the Royal Navy laptop it made me wonder if I could be affected. It's been over 16 years since I joined the Navy but 600,00 records were lost and there's only 36,500 personnel currently in the Navy. I know the 600,000 figure includes people who have just expressed an interest in joining the Navy but even so, it makes you wonder how many years back the records go. After all, if they're allowing full recruitment records to be copied out of a central database and onto a laptop, and they're not encrypting the laptop hard disk, they're probably not doing much to enforce the fifth principle of the Data Protection Act - ‚ÄòPersonal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes'.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The worst of the weather seems to behind us so it was business as usual this weekend.  A lot of time was spent in the pool.  We had a BBQ Saturday night with the neighbours, and I managed to get a gym session in on Saturday and a game of golf on Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>The golf was hard work to say the least.  Not just because it was the first time that I've played since coming to Australia and consequently I was rubbish (well, to be honest, I'm rubbish most of the time), but also because of the overbearing humidity.  We only did 9 holes but by the end of it I looked like I'd just come out of the swimming pool, the sweat was dripping off me.  Not an attractive look!  I was speaking to someone from Melbourne last week and they said that even though Melbourne has been suffering 40 degrees heat in the last few week, in Brisbane it feels like 40 when it's 30 due to the humidity.  I dread to think what it's like when it reaches 40 degrees here!  Thank God we have the use of a pool.  On that note I've been really proud to see how well Lauren's swimming has come on in the last few weeks.  She's like a fish now.  Her confidence has grown in bounds and she's jumping in and swimming underwater, something she wouldn't do only 2 months ago.</p>\n<p>On the work front I'm being kept really busy.  I've got 3 client projects, all 3 of which have strict deadlines to achieve security compliance or certification by March/April.  So all of the clients are panicking in one way or another and in turn they're piling the pressure on me to complete the work for them.  Luckily, a lot of the work I do for one client can easily be copied (with a few tweaks) over to the next so to them it looks like I'm delivering way above expectations.  Nevertheless, I don't think I've had a job since being on operations in the Navy where I've been constantly rushed off my feet.  I don't mind though.  The days go quick and after all, it is only 4 days a week.</p>\n<p>On the business front development is continuing at a snail's pace.  Every time I think the developers are close to finishing and getting ready for handover I find another problem.  After this is finished I reckon I can write a book about what to do and what not to do when outsourcing work to India!</p>\n",

I did have plans to get some xmas shopping done in Sydney but the mass of people was horrendous.  I can't understand people who go for a weekend away xmas shopping in the major cities.  I had to literally push my way through people just to get from one street to the next.</p>\n<p>Back to work tomorrow.  It's been a nice break having two weeks off but the weather has made it a bit of a let-down as I've hardly left the house.   I bought some new golf clubs last week so we went to the driving range yesterday to try them out.  On the way I stopped off and bought Lauren a junior set so she could have a go.  She loved it.  There's a par-3 9-hole course near us so hopefully it will be nice next weekend and we can go for a game.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Here's a run down of some books that I've recently read:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Spin Doctor's Diary: Inside Number 10 with New Labour by Lance Price</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/207f90e96e.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/207f90e96e.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left;cursor:pointer;width:200px;\" /></a>This book has been sitting on my to-read shelf for a while as it has been out since 2005.</p>\n<p>The main insight I got from this book was the extent to which Tony Blair, in his first terms as PM at least, was obsessed with the media.  It seems that everything that was ever written about spin was true.  He really did try and control the story, manipulate the media and twist facts to suit 'the official line'.  He was also very thin-skinned, obsessed with what journalists were saying about him in the papers.  From what I can understand he got over that after a few years as PM but even so it's pretty scary to see the extent to which government policy was, and perhaps still is, led by the media, and Rupert Mordoch (News International Corp owns 42% of the nationals in the UK) in particular.</p>\n<p>I've now started reading The Blair Years: Extracts from Alistair Campbell's diaries.  All 800 pages of it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Blind Faith by Ben Elton</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51f3Kzg0QML._AA240_.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51f3Kzg0QML._AA240_.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left;cursor:pointer;width:200px;\" /></a>This is another excellent satire by Ben Elton.  Yet again he really seems to be able to capture the zeitgeist of modern day culture.</p>\n<p>Blind Faith is set in a post-apocalyptic London where half the world seems to have flooded due to global warming.  It's a society where Christian (of sorts) religious fundamentalism reigns supreme  and where privacy is a sin.  A world where everyone is virtually naked and obsessed with sex, or at least pretends to be obsessed with sex, because not doing so would be to disrespect the body that 'The Love' i.e. God, has blessed you with, which in turn would be disrespecting 'The Love'.</p>\n<p>The story follows Trafford Sewell as he begins to discover what's hidden behind the curtain of the society that he knows and realises that he's not alone - he's not the only one who actually craves a little privacy and has doubts about the religious teachings.</p>\n<p>It's a bit like George Orwell's 1984 but with a modern spin.  Everyone is required to blog and add entries to their 'face page' (read <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\">facebook</a>) about every single aspect of their lives, and being (famous) is more important then doing.</p>\n<p>As the blurb on the back of the book says - 'A chilling vision of what's to come? Or something rather closer to what we call reality?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Ghost by Robert Harris</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512KI0WqkcL._AA240_.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512KI0WqkcL._AA240_.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left;cursor:pointer;width:200px;\" /></a>The Ghost follows the story of a professional ghostwriter who is given the opportunity to ghost the memoirs of Britain's former prime minister.  Soon after starting to work on the book he realises that not all's what it seems.</p>\n<p>The Ghost is yet another intelligent thriller from the author who penned one of my favourite books - Fatherland.  The fictitious former prime minister is clearly Tony Blair - a man who is on the verge of being indicted by the International Criminal Court on war crimes after authorising CIA rendition of British Citizens suspected of being Al Qaeda terrorists.</p>\n<p>As well as being an excellent thriller, with twists and turns aplenty, The Ghost is clearly a damning examination of Britain's foreign policy since 2001.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Utility of Force by Rupert Smith</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7b85bd7a2f.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7b85bd7a2f.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left;cursor:pointer;width:200px;\" /></a>The Utility of Force is basically a long essay by a very distinguished British General.</p>\n<p>The books charts the history of warfare from the rise of Industrial Warfare during the Napoleonic wars to the conflicts of today.  Moreover, the book examines the importance of the trinity (the military, the state, and the people) in winning wars and argues that today's western armies have to substantially adapt to face the conflicts of the future.</p>\n<p>The book is a tad long and repetitive but he makes some very good points, and his analysis of the relationship between politics and warfare is excellent, particularly when he examines the 'wars-by-proxy' which were the Korean and Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>Playing with Fire by Gordon Ramsay</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fad0ec9d9a.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fad0ec9d9a.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left;cursor:pointer;width:200px;\" /></a>After really enjoying Gordon's first autobiography 'Humble Pie', I couldn't wait to read this follow-up.</p>\n<p>Whereas Humble Pie focuses on his early days and his extraordinary culinary skills and successes in the kitchen, Playing with Fire focuses on the business side of Gordon Ramsay Holdings.</p>\n<p>Playing with Fire is a fascinating insight into both the 5 star restaurant business but also the commercial life of a celebrity chef.</p>\n<p>He's very frank and honest in the book, to the extent that he even discloses the fees he earned and amount he paid for property, and his obsessiveness and determination are clear throughout.  There are some excellent lessons in here about business and life in general.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Facing Up by Bear Grylls</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KJcmSWHVL._AA240_.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KJcmSWHVL._AA240_.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left;cursor:pointer;width:200px;\" /></a>Facing Up was first published in 2000 and I didn't even know it existed until I came across it in a book sale a few months ago, which I was surprised about as I'm a big fan of the work of Bear Grylls.</p>\n<p>Facing Up is Bear's own account of his successful attempt, at the age of 23, to be the youngest person to reach the summit of Everest.</p>\n<p>It is an inspiring account of what it takes to do what still only a relatively small number of extraordinary people in the world have achieved.  As well as being a breathtaking read, it was a real eye opener to why climbing Everest is still the ultimate test for man.</p>\n<p>Here's a few interesting facts I learnt from this book:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There have been over 200 deaths on Mount Everest</li>\n<li>It costs roughly $25,000 to climb Everest.  A good proportion of the cost is attributed to the permit and the fees for obtaining daily meteorological reports for conditions around the summit.</li>\n<li>There's only two periods during the year that an attempt on the summit can be made.  This is due to the hurricane-scale winds that swirl around the summit during the monsoon season (the size of Everest means it actually creates its own weather system).</li>\n<li>In the book Bear explains how Everest is one of only a few places still left in the world which can only be reached by human endurance only, as Helicopters can't reach that high because the air is too thin for the blades to grip.  This was written before the 2005 helicopter landing by Frenchman Didier Delsalle in a Eurocopter AS 350 B3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're a fan of his TV programmes you'll certainly enjoy this book.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Last weekend I finished watching the final series of The West Wing, and sad as it may sound, there‚Äôs now a big hole in my life.</p>\n<p>I only discovered The West Wing last year after someone recommended it to me.  I never caught it when it was shown on TV so I went back to the beginning and bought the DVD‚Äôs.  After watching the first episode of the first series, I soon new that this would become my favourite programme on TV.</p>\n<p>Regularly over the last year I‚Äôve sat down on a Friday night, opened a bottle of red wine, and watched a 4-episode disc.  It got towards the end that I couldn‚Äôt watch an episode without first opening a bottle of wine ‚Äì it somehow gave me a nostalgic feeling.  You know you‚Äôre getting old when the nostalgia you feel on a Friday night is towards a bottle of wine and a political drama, rather than a night out on the town with the lads!</p>\n<p>It may seem strange that a TV programme can have such an impact, but for me, The West Wing is the most intelligent, moving, insightful and intriguing TV programme ever made.  The research that went into each series was outstanding; both the look and feel of the White House as well as the way the political stories were presented, many of which seemed to mirror present day events.  Best of all was the character development.  We followed the whole team from beginning to end of both terms of the Bartlett Presidency and watched as relationships developed, and individuals struggled to cope with the enormity of their responsibilities.</p>\n<p>The series was very successful in capturing the dynamics and dynamism of the west wing of the White House, to a degree that you could imagine that is exactly how it would be working in arguably the most powerful offices in the world.  I was often on the edge of my seat and could feel a palpable rise in my heart rate trying to keep up with the characters on screen working at 100 miles per hour as they were trying to simultaneously deal with incidents, power broking, and handling the demands of the 24/7 media.  It was truly breathtaking stuff.  The ‚Äòwalk with me‚Äô lines, where fast-paced conversations flip from one topic to the next while the characters walk between meetings in the west wing are now written into popular culture.</p>\n<p>Not sure what I‚Äôm going to do on a Friday night now.  I may have to start again at series 1!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Following up from my last post, when Mike mentioned he was taking me to a nice steak restaurant in Sydney I expected a 'Sizzler' or something like that.  Instead, we went to the Prime restaurant in the<a href=\"http://www.gposydney.com/\"> GPO Sydney</a> building where they have a steak on the menu for $155.</p>\n<p>I thought I new about steak until I went there.</p>\n<p>Their speciality is Wagyu beef and according to the menu:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Wagyu is a western term for a collection of Japanese bloodlines (Wa-Japan, Gyu-Cattle).</p>\n<p>It is generally accepted that Wagyu beef is the highest grade, and tastiest beef in the world. The marbling of the Wagyu beef is the Prime characteristic that contributes to its tenderness, juiciness and most importantly its flavour.</p>\n<p>The highest grade of Wagyu has a marbling score of A12. However, this is only available in Japan. While other breeds of cattle are not given a marbling score, it can be said for comparative reasons that other breeds of cattle having a maximum marbling score of 3.</p>\n<p>In Australia, Wagyu branded meat is predominantly F1 crosses between Wagyu and Angus cattle. The Japanese preference when the Wagyu is not Full Blood, is for F1 crosses to be between Wagyu and Holstein cattle which we have chosen for your enjoyment in Prime.</p>\n<p>Outside Japan there is a limited supply of Full Blood Wagyu and an even more limited supply of marble score plus 9 Wagyu.</p>\n<p>The plus 9 Wagyu selected for Prime is the highest scored Wagyu product available outside Japan and has been sourced from David Blackmore, Australia.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So what did it taste like you may ask?  God knows, the meal was on company expenses so I didn't dare go for the Wagyu.  I would have been sacked on Monday!</p>\n<p>Instead I went for the more modest Black Angus - Scotch Fillet (300g), Rib eye without bone,  200-250 days grainfed, full matured at 24-36  months old.  It was nice, but I couldn't help wonder what the Wagyu would have tasted like.</p>\n<p>I seem to be drooling.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I'm currently in Sydney for a couple of days meeting with a client - my first business trip of what I'm told will be many for my new employer.</p>\n<p>I flew up yesterday afternoon with a colleague who I'm taking over from on this particular client project as he's leaving next week.  We're staying in the Bayview Boulevard in the Woolloomooloo area of Sydney.  The hotel is actually pretty good - it's recently been refurbished so everything is shiny and new, and I've got a partial view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge from my room, as the photo below shows (taken with my camera phone).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/8ae64-image-upload-257-708264.jpe\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/452685d5c1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5137790760830546146\" /></a><br />Last night we went for a walk about and stopped off for a meal at a really nice side-street Italian Trattoria.  I had Black mussels as an entree and a home-made fettuccine concoction for main.  Finally had a decent Italian in Australia!</p>\n<p>After the meal we went to a pub and caught the last 30 minutes of the Sydney FC v LA Galaxy game.  David Beckham had managed to draw 80,000 to the Sydney Olympic stadium - unheard of for a 'soccer' match in Australia.  They even showed the match live on Channel 10 (one of the main channels in Oz).  Beckham pleased the fans scoring with one of his trademark free-kicks, although his side lost 5-3 in the end.  I couldn't believe all the plaudits by the commentators after the game, and then on TV this morning.  Beckham mania is still alive and strong, at least in Sydney anyway.</p>\n<p>Mike, my colleague, has recommended a nice steak restaurant this evening so we'll be going there shortly.  Don't you just love company expenses!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>A quick run down of what we got up to last weekend:</p>\n<p>On Friday Rach took the day off and went to Australia Zoo with Steph and the kids. I managed to get out of it and stayed at home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2087/2062178614_d6546c3cf3_o.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2087/2062178614_d6546c3cf3_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />When they got back Rach, Steph and Julie from next door went for a night out in the city, returning about 2am - the dirty stop-outs!</p>\n<p>On Saturday morning we all went to Manly for Bonny's birthday BBQ.  Bonny, who's 11, is Cath's daughter (Cath is Rachelle's godmother) and both are the closest thing we have to family in Brisbane.  It was really weird having a BBQ and eating birthday cake by the ocean at 9:30 in the morning.  Nice though!</p>\n<p>After the BBQ, I went home while Rach took Steph and the kids to Sea World.  It only seemed like 2 minutes since we last visited Sea World so I gave it a miss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2035/2062189968_5acc4cb3f2_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2035/2062189968_5acc4cb3f2_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />When they got back we were invited next door as it was Reyce's birthday (George and Julie's daughter).  One drink turned into many and before I new it myself and George were finishing off a bottle of rum.  I left him at 1:30am passed out on the sofa - this time Navy had won in the Navy v Air Force drinking contest!</p>\n<p>On Sunday we went in the pool in the morning (to sober up), then went out at lunchtime to Mcdonald's for Reyce's birthday party.</p>\n<p>Not a bad weekend I'd say considering it's November.  Sure beats the weekends I used to have in November - cold and wet is all I can remember about Novembers in the UK.</p>\n<p>It's now been 6 months since we arrived and I still feel in holiday mode.  I plan to stay in holiday mode!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/\">More photo's on flickr.</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Last Thursday, Rachelle picked me up straight from work and we drove 2 hours north to Noosa on the northern end of the Sunshine Coast.  I had booked an apartment for us at the <a href=\"http://www.noosatropicana.com.au\">Noosa Tropicana</a>.</p>\n<p>Noosa is beautiful, and includes beautiful white sand beaches; a large national park complete with spectacular coastal scenery, wildlife (including Koalas) and waterfalls; and the Noosa river which winds its way north for 85 km and continues past Lakes Cooroibah and Cootharaba to unspoilt Everglades.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Friday was hot and sunny so we were able to spend some quality time at the beach and make up for the crap weather we've had ever since Steph and Lucy arrived.  The conditions were perfect - perfect for swimming but also with the occasional large wave to jump through/over/under.  I wasn't as sensible with the sun cream as I usually am and ended up burning my back - it's still soar today!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2310/2046319317_9e451269aa_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2310/2046319317_9e451269aa_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />Friday night we made use of our penthouse facilities.  Having a penthouse apartment meant we had our own private rooftop with BBQ, so we chucked a few steaks on the barbie and cracked open a couple of bottles of wine.</p>\n<p>On Saturday Rach took Steph and the kids to Eumundi markets while I went for a walk and explored the local area.  When they returned Steph wasn't feeling too well so she stayed in the apartment while me, Rach and the kids went down to the Noosa river and hired a boat.  We hired a 6-seater Bowrider and went exploring for two hours up the Noosa river.  The boat we hired wouldn't do any more than 10 knots so there was no way we was going to make it anywhere near the Everglades.  Lauren and Lucy loved it, they both had a go at steering.  Lauren even took an interest when Rach taught her how to read the charts (of course we're experts now we've completed the 1 day boat course!).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2252/2046293645_7977500eb5_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2252/2046293645_7977500eb5_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2321/2046266491_b6542dbbf2_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2321/2046266491_b6542dbbf2_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />On Saturday night we went to a Thai Restaurant.  I drank far too much wine and woke up feeling like I was going to die on Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>We had planned to go exploring in Noosa National Park on Sunday but it was absolutely pissing it down so we checked out and drove back home Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>All in all it was a really good weekend, although I was a bit disappointed by the Noosa Tropicana.  It's supposedly a 4 1/2 star apartment but it was in desperate need of a refurbishment.</p>\n<p>More photo's on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily\">Flickr</a>.</p>\n",

The first project I've been given is to help a client - a subsidiary of a well-known Japanese car manufacturer - achieve compliance with Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Law, which is Japan's equivalent of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX).     </p>\n<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was brought in after the well-publicised financial reporting scandals involving the likes of Enron and WorldCom.  The aim of the Act being to strengthen requirements regarding corporate governance and internal control.  Amongst other things this means that companies listed on the US stock exchange must be able to demonstrate strong internal controls that can prevent and detect fraud.  The Japanese equivalent, nicknamed J-SOX, was also established after scandals involving listed companies in Japan and has similar requirements.</p>\n<p>My job is to help the client address the high-priority security weaknesses that have been identified and establish controls for these before March 2008 - when J-SOX comes into effect.  What this means in practice is that I'll be carrying out interviews with different areas of their business to understand exactly what security controls are in place now and provide recommendations on additional controls.  My company is then hoping that the client will ask me to help them with implementation - which will mean writing security policies and procedures, giving them guidance on securing their IT systems, as well as helping them implement new security systems where required such as Intrusion Prevention technology - the aim being to try and cross-sell as many of our companies' services and solutions as possible.</p>\n<p>It's not the most exciting job in the world but it pays the bills.</p>\n",

We went to Amici's, an Italian restaurant on the South Bank in Brisbane Friday night, but the service was atrocious and the food pretty bland.  Then, with the weather being bad on Saturday we went for a long lunch while down on the Gold Coast.  And it was a long lunch.  Again, the service was crap, we waited ages and when our meals finally arrived they screwed up the order.

I was being rushed to make the change so didn't give enough thought to what I was doing.  If I'd have sat back and thought about it for a second I would have realised that what had been requested would cause problems.  Anyway, I tried to back-out the change but I couldn't connect to the server at all remotely - all communications with it had gone down.  So I figured I'd have to go over to the data centre and log on to it locally at the console, but...</p>\n<p>As I was about to leave, the entry system on the doors to our floors went tits-up and locked us in.  Now that's a poorly designed entry system.  I know most security systems are supposed to fail-safe into a secure state but surely a basic risk assessment would determine that allowing people to quickly get out of the building in an emergency should be an higher priority than stopping intruders getting in?  We ended up being locked in for 90 minutes.</p>\n<p>Luckily for me, the server in question isn't in production yet, it's still in UAT (User Acceptance Testing). Nonetheless I still needed to get it quickly up and running again as there are strict deadlines on delivering the milestones of the project.</p>\n<p>Besides that when I finally made it out for a late lunch I went to the Queensland Transport Office to pick up my Recreational Marine Drivers Licence, only to discover, after waiting for 30 minutes, that I didn't have enough ID on me.</p>\n<p>On my way back to the office I popped in to McDonalds to buy a relatively healthy sub-roll, and it was only when I was halfway through eating it that it dawned on me that I was in fact eating a cheeseburger.  They'd given me the wrong order (honest, Guv)! </p>\n<p>Back at the office I then discovered that the problem I had earlier with the server had caused another problem.  I called out for help to Ken, the Check Point guru, and he quickly realised that we'd have to roll-back the entire server config and do a restore from the last backup.  But of course, when Ken went to do the restore it completely failed - the backups hadn't worked properly.  In the end we had to go back to a full system snapshot that we had taken on the 8th October, meaning that all the changes that I've made between the 8th Oct and now have been lost - I'd have to do it all again.  Luckily I have a record of all the changes and it should be no more than a couple of hours work but even so it's a pain.  It just goes to show the importance of testing your backups!</p>\n<p>I hate stupid computers! And security systems! And McDonalds. And Queensland Transport regulations!</p>\n",

Last night we had a fantastic lightning storm.  One really loud crack of thunder made us jump out of our seats.  I ran upstairs to check Lauren was alright as I was sure it must have scared her to death, and unbelievably she was still asleep.  How she had slept through that I'll never know.</p>\n<p>It's getting really hot out here now, we were all wilting over the weekend.  I've been trying to hold-off on using the air-con unless absolutely necessary, for a number of reasons:</p>\n<p>1) It costs money;<br />2) It's bad for the environment;<br />3) It dries out your skin; and<br />4) It won't help us acclimatise.</p>\n<p>We gave in Friday night though and switched it on for a bit.  I don't mind the heat during the day but being hot and sticky at night is not very pleasurable.  It's not so bad downstairs in our house but upstairs is a different matter - it's like a sauna even with all the windows open.  We've got air-con and a overhead fan in our bedroom but there's nothing in Lauren's room or the spare bedroom.  We've put a standing fan in Lauren's room but all that's doing at the moment is moving warm air.  It looks like we'll have to buy air-con units for both rooms.  My computer equipment is in the spare bedroom as it doubles up as my office so it's getting dangerous to turn them on without air-con. </p>\n<p>We at least have one reprieve - it's so nice to be able to go and jump in a swimming pool whenever we want to to cool down!</p>\n",

The reason they do this is because it establishes their credibility, which is particularly important if you want people to 'buy in' to your status as an expert on a particular subject.  By posting their income report on a blog about making money by blogging, they are showing that they 'eat their own dog food' so to speak and know what they are talking about.</p>\n<p>Two of the blogs that I subscribe to that are seen as authorities on blogging and Internet marketing are www.johnchow.com, and www.entrepreneurs-journey.com by Yaro Starak (a fellow Brisbanite).</p>\n<p>In September, John Chow made $20,512.17 and Yaro made $10,899.83.

You can literally start a business from scratch - you don't need money to make money.  It doesn't cost a penny to start a blog.</p>\n<p>I personally have decided against adding advertising on this blog.  This was never meant to be a commercial enterprise - simply a means of communicating to friends and family now that I'm on the other side of the world.  I have considered launching a couple of commercial blogs.   I've even registered some domain names.

				"content_text": "<p>Just a brief update for the last week:</p>\n<p>We had a pretty quiet weekend with the exception of Saturday night which somehow turned into a beer fest.  Our alcoholic kiwi neighbours - Julie and George - came round for a beer late Saturday afternoon and I somehow managed to stay up drinking with George until 2:30am Sunday morning!  Needless to say I was feeling rough on Sunday so we never made it to the planned BBC meetup (British Brisbane Club) in the city.  I blame George.  He discovered our Wii Sports game and being an ex New Zealand Air Force PTI he doesn't like to lose at sport, even if it is virtual sport.  The thing is, I'm quite competitive as well and don't like to lose (I even struggle to bring myself to let Lauren win a game!), so I kept playing him again and again determined not to give up my 100% record.  At one point I thought we'd end up playing and drinking through until the Rugby World Cup final started at 5am Sunday.  Luckily for both of us we agreed to call it a day at 2:30am.  My right arm is still aching today - I'm not sure if it's from the Tennis or Boxing.</p>\n<p>On the job front my start date for the permie position has been put back a week to the 12th November to give me more time to complete the operational handover of the project I'm working on.  I'm really looking forward to those 3-day weekends.  I know I'll be spending my free Friday working on the business but at least I'll be at home.</p>\n<p>The only crap thing about the new position is the holiday situation.  Australians don't tend to get as much annual leave as we're used to in Britain - typically 20 days per annum as opposed to 25.  So pro-rata for me that will work out as 16 days (four weeks).  As I mentioned previously, my employers shut down for two weeks over xmas and we have to use our leave allocation whether we want to or not, which will work out as 5 days for me.  This only leaves me with 11 days for the rest of the year.  I was planning on taking my leave to coincide with when we have visitors over.  We haven't got any visitors over xmas!  Mum, Dad, if you're reading this, I don't suppose you mind me and Rach going on holiday to Bali for a couple of weeks while you're over here do you?  Just kidding.</p>\n<p>Work is still continuing in India on the two websites I'm having developed.  The first of which should be ready within the next month.  The mock-ups of both sites that I have been presented with by the developers look really good - I'm very excited about both prospects!  I wish they'd hurry up though, I'm really keen to get stuck in and try out my ideas.</p>\n<p>This Saturday coming myself and Rach are booked into a full-day Boat Licence course.  If we pass we'll be licenced to wreak havoc on the waterways!  I might even take up sea fishing.</p>\n",

On my first day I went in with the intention of asking if there was any way I could alter the 9am -3pm shift which was advertised to 8.30am - 2.30pm so I can pick Lauren up from school, I didn't need to ask she offered.  I get 1/2 hour break for lunch which I take in the bistro upstairs.  I sit and watch the boats, it's so relaxing.   I'm waiting for the Dolphins to come back.  They were there one day but I was in the middle of banking and couldn't go and look. </p>\n<p>The club has 20+ pokies (slot machines) and are looking at expanding this very soon.  They couldn't get over the fact that the UK pubs only have a couple of machines in and asked how do they make money?  The amount made from the pokies is unreal.   Every Monday morning we have to empty the machines it's all very very precise and the gaming commission can come in at any time to inspect.  You have to have a licence to touch the inside of the machines - it really is big business.  (I'll be going for my licence soon)</p>\n<p>There are quite a few expats members of the club and as soon as they hear me talk they are even more friendly.  One woman is from Leeds, she's been here 45 years and has still got a very strong Leeds accent.  My boss Jan is actually from Cumbria but has been here since she was 6 so is very Aussie - it made me realise that me and Daryl will probably keep our accents but after a few years no-one would ever know Lauren was a pommie!  She has started to say words differently but we don't say anything as we want her to fit in at school and that's all part of it.  Our neighbours love to listen to her Yorkshire accent but by the sound of it not for much longer!</p>\n",

Well guess what, this week Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Oasis, and, wait for it, Madonna, have all announced that they're dumping their record labels. </p>\n<p>This is going to be interesting to watch.  My bet is that in 10 years time the only artists on EMI's books will be X-Factor runners-up!</p>\n",

With Rach starting a new job on Monday and with me securing a new job, and with Cath volunteering to babysit for Lauren, we decided to try out one of Brisbane's award winning restaurants last night.</p>\n<p>We chose <a href=\"http://www.il-centro.com.au/\">Il Centro</a> in the CBD.</p>\n<p>This is what I had:</p>\n<blockquote><p>POLPI E SEPPI SALTATI IN BURRO D‚Äô OLIO E PREZZEMOLO CON CROSTINO<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SAUTEED OCTOPUS AND SQUID IN GARLIC AND PARSLEY BUTTER WITH SLOW BRAISED VINE RIPENED TOMATO, EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL AND CRUSHED OLIVE CROSTINO</span></p>\n<p>SCALOPPINE DI VITELLO CON FETTUCCINE CARBONARA<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">PARMESAN CRUMBED VEAL SCALOPPINE WITH FETTUCCINE CARBONARA AND WILTED SPINACH</span></p>\n<p>FRITTE TIEPIDO CON GELATO E SALSA DI CIOCCOLATO CALDO<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">WARM PROFITEROLES WITH CARAMEL GELATO AND HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Rach had:</p>\n<blockquote><p>CAPE SANTE IN PADELLA CON RISOTTO GLI ASPARAGI E PROSCIUTTO<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SAUTEED SCALLOPS WITH LIME CARNAROLI RISOTTO,ASPARAGUS AND PROSCIUTTO AND TARRAGON JUS</span></p>\n<p>ANATRA CROCCANTE ARROSTO, PATATE CON SPINACI E RUCOLA<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SLOW ROASTED CRISP DUCK BREAST WITH AMARENA CHERRIES AND BLACK PEPPER SALSA,DUCK FAT BINTJE POTATO, CREAMED SPINACH AND ROCKET</span></p>\n<p>TORTINO AL CIOCCOLATO TIEPIDO CON GELATO E SALSA DI CARAMELLO<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">WARM CHOCOLATE TART WITH PASSIONFRUIT AND WHITE CHOCOLATE GELATO AND CARAMEL SAUCE</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"></span><br />All in all, whilst the setting and service was excellent, the food was a bit of a let-down.  Whilst no part was particularly bad, the food overall was a little bit bland - it didn't live up to the promise of the menu.  Looking again at the website I can see that whilst Il Centro has won awards, it has been a number of years since the last one.</p>\n<p>The total cost including drinks came to $215 (¬£90) which was about what I expected for a prestigious riverside restaurant, although in the end it proved to be slightly overpriced for the quality of the cooking.</p>\n<p>We had a good night nonetheless.  Especially afterwards when we watched England beat the Wallabies in the Rugby World Cup.  I think I'm going to enjoy giving the aussies some stick next week at work!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On the 10th October, Radiohead will release their new album '<a href=\"http://www.inrainbows.com/\">In Rainbows</a>'.  More interestingly however, the album will be made available as a download from their own website and we, the customer, can decide how much we want to pay for it.  If we don't like it, we don't have to pay a penny!  What's more, they haven't signed a deal with any of the major record labels or the major distributors, including iTunes, and there will be no promo's for the album.   They'll be releasing it and distributing it themselves, and it will be made available to everyone at the same time.</p>\n<p>Radiohead are regarded by many as the best band in the world, which is what makes this announcement even more important.  According to an A&amp;R Executive at a major label, as quoted in <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1666973,00.html\">this Time artice</a> - \"If the best band in the world doesn't want a part of us, I'm not sure what's left for this business ... if you can pay whatever you want for music by the best band in the world, why would you pay $13 dollars or $.99 cents for music by somebody less talented? Once you open that door and start giving music away legally, I'm not sure there's any going back\".</p>\n<p>This comes at a time when the record labels and the RIAA (Record Industry Association of America) in particular are facing increasing criticism over their approach to music copyright protection.  It wasn't long ago that it was discovered that SonyBMG was surreptitiously including Rootkit installers in CD's to enforce copyright protection - when the CD was placed in your computer CDROM drive an hidden installer would install the copyright protection on your PC without you knowing.  Once this became public SonyBMG had to quickly backtrack after what become a PR disaster for them.</p>\n<p>And just this week, in yet another RIAA lawsuit in America, SonyBMG's head of litigation, Jennifer Pariser, while testifying before a jury, stated that making a copy of purchased music was tantamount to stealing, even if you'd bought the CD and was simply making a backup.  So in the eyes of the record labels, if we download music or buy it on CD and then copy it to our MP3 player, which most people do these days, we are in fact thieves.  With an attitude like that it's no wonder that many people don't think twice about downloading music illegally.</p>\n<p>The truth is , in every area of business, the Internet is introducing new business models that give more power to us, the consumer, and increasingly allows small business' to take on the big guys.  It's truly democratising the world, well at least those parts of the world that have access to the Internet! If the big corporations don't recognise this and adapt to it, they'll quickly lose market share.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've been offered a new job and I've accepted.  What's more, I've got them to agree to a 4-day week!</p>\n<p>The project I'm working on for my day job is due to hand over to Operations in November, meaning my involvement would end at that point.  Last week my employer called me in for a chat to discuss the future.  Their Security Compliance arm of the business is really taking off and they need to strengthen the team to cope with the growing volume of work.  They asked me if I'd consider joining their Compliance consultancy on a permanent basis.</p>\n<p>I'm contracting at the moment and since becoming an IT Contractor I vowed I would never go back to being a 'permie'.  However, circumstances have changed. Here's my thinking:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>IT Contracting is not a lucrative proposition in Australia like it is in the UK.  For a start, the rates mean I only get paid roughly the same as a permie, and secondly the legal and tax situation is different meaning I can't get the same financial benefits working under my own company like I did in the UK.  Basically, contracting here is just like being a casual employee. </li>\n<li>Christmas is not too far away and the company I work for shuts down for two weeks over xmas.  As a contractor I don't get paid for holidays and sickness.  Even if they found me another project straight away, if I stayed with them on a contract basis I would have to take 2 weeks unpaid leave over xmas.  Signing on as a permie I get two weeks paid leave! </li>\n<li>Everyone keeps telling me that their is a skills shortage in Brisbane but whenever I look on the job sites a) I'm not seeing much contract work, and b) most of the work seems to to be on the network/firewall side of things, similar to the project I'm assigned to now, which doesn't really interest me and is not my core expertise. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>With all that in mind, I decided my best option would be to try and find a way to guarantee a decent income for the foreseeable future, but also reduce my hours doing a 'proper job' so I could devote more time to my Internet projects.</p>\n<p>So, when they called me in for a chat I made it clear that I would consider going permie only if I could reduce my hours to four days a week.</p>\n<p>Yesterday they made me an offer.  They met my salary expectations and they've agreed to the four-day week.  I love it when a plan comes together!</p>\n<p>I cut over to permie at the beginning of November.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Another great weekend.  On Saturday we went to the beach again.  We've been trying different beaches each time for a little variety.  The beaches here go on for miles and miles and there's never any problem finding a quiet one.  The only problem being though that the quiet beaches often aren't patrolled by Surf LifeSavers so they don't advise you to go swimming.  This weekend we fancied a swim so we went to one of the patrolled beaches.  We chose Couloundra, the first resort from us on the Sunshine Coast about 1hr and 20 minutes drive.  King's Beach at Couloundra turned out to be really family-friendly.  For a change, the waves were only small so it was easily swimmable.  Even Rach went in!</p>\n<p>On Sunday we went for a community BBQ at the park near where we live.  Everywhere you go in Australia you'll find public BBQ's provided by the council free of charge - every park, by the river and by the beach.  Most are electric but you still find some wood-burning BBQ's knocking about.  It was a wood-burning BBQ that we used on Sunday.  Luckily there were already some pre-cut logs waiting for us as none of us had thought to bring an axe.</p>\n<p>Besides us, there was a family from Scotland, a family from India and a family from France.  We all chipped in and shared each other's food and booze, and me and Craig (Scotland) tended to the barbie.   </p>\n<p>It's so nice to be able to make plans for the weekend without having to worry about the weather forecast. It's 30 degrees every day here at the moment.  It's got to the point where we've started to put the fan on at night.  We've managed to resist the temptation to put the A/C on yet though - not good for our electric bill or the environment!</p>\n",

Thank God I got my phobia sorted out (Thank you Pam Birchall) because I can honestly say if I hadn't I would never dare leave the house again after seeing what I saw yesterday.</p>\n<p>A few mum's had met up at a friends house the kids were out playing on the bikes, all of a sudden it went quiet.  We went out to see why?  Lauren had come in for a tissue (thank God) but the other 3 kids were sat in somebody's garden their bikes left in the middle of the road.  Jacqui (Daniels mum and fellow expat) went over and asked why they were in the garden and left the bikes in the road.  The kids said they were hiding from the magpies.  Obviously Jacqui told them to stop being silly and get out of the garden and move the bikes.  Well.....  The minute Lucas got on his bike this magpie came out of nowhere and started chasing him down the road really going for him.  It was vicious, we were shouting and trying to scare the magpie away but the faster Lucas rode the more the magpie went for him.  It was horrible.  None of us could do a thing we were shouting for Lucas to stop but obviously a 6 year old boy being chased by an angry bird is not going to stop easily.  Eventually after about 200 metres or more he jumped off his bike and came running back to the house screaming his head off.  (who could blame him)  The magpie followed him then sat in a tree watching him. </p>\n<p>We got all the kids back into the house but then realised the bikes were still strewn all over the street left where the petrified kids had dropped them, the mum's had to go and get them!  We all went out at the same time, one magpie can't attack us all at once.  Sure enough it came down and swooped at Jacqui who had gone for Lucas' bike.  She very calmly walked back to the house (never letting her eye leave the damn bird) and thankfully the bird flew back to it's tree.  It was really really horrible - I would never have believed a magpie would do that if I hadn't seen it myself.  You could actually hear it's beak snapping as it was going for Lucas' head.  (thankfully helmet on)</p>\n<p>When I took Lauren to the park last week there were signs up saying beware of the magpies but I never took it that seriously. </p>\n<p>I do now.</p>\n",

I'm trying to recall but I don't think I was gullible enough to fall for any of them.  It didn't stop them trying though.  Like the first week on my first ship when I was presented with an electricity bill for my bunk light.

It was amazing to see the line forming outside the onboard post office for changing Pounds to Gibraltar Giberoons!</p>\n<p>Some of the pipes were pretty funny too.. like 'OM Thalidimide to the Small Arms Store'.

				"content_text": "<p>I thought it was about time that I posted again as I've neglected this blog over the last few weeks due to other distractions.</p>\n<p>The truth is I've been obsessed with working on my internet 'projects'.</p>\n<p>I've got two projects on the go:</p>\n<p>1) I'm still a partner in Autonomy Business Solutions Ltd of which our main venture is a website selling Voice over IP (VoIP) phones and associated hardware.  My original plan when I emigrated to Australia was to drop my share in the business down to 10%, however, this was before I decided that I was going to start an Internet business of my own.  It quickly dawned on me that in the 'Internet age' I could still make a valuable contribution to the business in the UK, and I would be stupid to give it up, especially when it's making a profit (however small) even though it as always been a part-time project and we've hardly done anything to market it.</p>\n<p>I've learnt a lot about Internet marketing over the last few weeks.  My aim is to take what I've learnt, and continue to learn, about Internet marketing and apply it to the website.  First of all though, it became clear that we had to start again with the website.</p>\n<p>So in agreement with Michael (my business partner) we have put a project out for tender on <a href=\"http://www.elance.com/\">www.elance.com</a> to develop a new website to meet all our requirements.  We've chosen a company to do the work, drawn up a contract and Functional Requirements, and as of yesterday, the terms of the contract have been agreed and development is underway.</p>\n<p>I'm so glad I read the 4-hour Work Week by Tim Ferris otherwise I never would have known about Elance.  Elance has allowed us to outsource the work to a company in India for a fraction of the cost it would have been if we had got a local company to do it.</p>\n<p>Once the new website is ready I'll give more details on what we're trying to achieve with the new site and point out the flaws (my flaws - I originally built the thing) in the old (current) site.</p>\n<p>2) My second project is my 'Social Network'.  I don't want to go in to too many details at the moment but this is what has been keeping me up working until 1am over the last few weeks and which nearly burnt me out.</p>\n<p>In an effort to save money I decided to attempt to build the site myself.  The site is going to be a social network along the lines of myspace, facebook, bebo, etc but for a particular niche demographic.  I got stuck in to developing the site and made some good progress to start with.  However, I soon got stuck on some of the technicalities of the site.  You see, to achieve some of the functionality I want you need to at least have a decent understanding of databases (in this case MySQL) and the programming language that the site uses (PHP).  I was so determined to build the site myself that I was trying to learn PHP and MySQL on the fly.  I got absolutely obsessed with the site and spent hours working on the technicalities trying to get the damn thing to work.  I soon realised that at the rate I was going it would be a good 6 months before the site would be ready.</p>\n<p>It was at this point that I took onboard the advice in some of the books that I've read recently such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280\">The E-myth by Michael Gerber</a>, as well as Rich Dad Poor Dad and the 4-Hour Work Week which I mentioned in my posts about <a href=\"http://darylandrach.blogspot.com/2007/08/im-starting-internet-business.html\">starting an Internet business</a>.  The point being that (1) I need to put a financial value on my time and (2) concentrate on being the Entrepreneur, not the Technician.  I shall explain:\n<ol>\n<li>Sometimes, doing things myself to save money is actually false economy.  This instance was a good example of that principle.  I would have spent 6 months of my life working on the technicalities of building a site, whereas instead I could be spending that 6 months working on ideas, content, features and marketing to meet the primary objective of the site - creating passive income.</li>\n<li>Many small businesses fail because the owner spends too much time working <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">in</span> the business and not <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">on</span> the business.  If this thing is going to work I need to spend my time working on developing the business overall and not get bogged down on the technical stuff which someone else could do a lot better and a lot more quickly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I'm going to concentrate on the ideas and the vision of the business.  I'll let someone else put my ideas into being.  My social network project was posted on elance.com a couple of days ago and I'm reviewing bids as they come in.  I've budgeted ¬£1000 for the project which isn't much for the complexity of the site but I'm confident elance will come good.</p>\n<p>I worked it out, at the rate I was going it would have took me 840 hours to build the site.  So for a cost of ¬£1000 that would have been roughly the equivalent of ¬£1:19p per hour.  I value my time at a lot more than ¬£1:19 per hour!</p>\n<p>When I finally gave up and made the decision to outsource the work it was such a relief.  I was literally killing myself working a full-time job and then coming home every night working on the business until midnight.  I know the dream of a 4-hour work week can only be achieved once you've actually established the passive income but even so, there are better ways to do it.</p>\n<p>So these are the main two projects I've got going at the moment, and I've got ideas for many more in the pipeline.  It's a bit of a gamble I know but I can't stand the thought of working for someone else doing a 9-5 job for the rest of my life.  I'm still working hard every night on the business, but I'm limiting myself to a couple of hours rather than the ridiculous hours I was doing before.  More importantly, I'm working <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">on </span>my business, not <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">in</span> my business.</p>\n<p>I'm also making sure the weekends are dedicated to family time.  We came to Australia for the dream lifestyle and I somehow forgot about that when I got obsessed with developing websites.  I won't make that mistake again.  The weekend before last, the day after I made the decision to outsource project 2, we spend Saturday at the beach and then most of Sunday afternoon in a beer garden!  This weekend gone we spent some time doing some long overdue organising in the house, and on Sunday we had Cath and the neighbours round for a BBQ.  Lauren even went for her first dip in the complex pool which is literally 30 feet from our front door.  The pool is in the shade most of the day so doesn't really get warm but Lauren was straight in, no messing!  I might even venture in this weekend.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm still doing a bit of work on the business at weekends but I'm not going to let it overtake my life like I had been.</p>\n",

He told me where it was so I went out armed with my camera but it was really well hidden in a big bush and I couldn't see it.  Needless to say I wouldn't let Lauren play out (much to her annoyance) and have requested that the manager of our complex trim the bush back.   The gardener said it was only a green tree snake which aren't poisonous but they do bite and it does hurt - alot!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It seems that the winter has passed and we are now head first into Spring.  We decided to make the most of our weekend and went to the beach on Saturday.  We really must get more into the swing of beach visits.  We forgot Lauren's hat, bucket and spade so had to go and buy yet another.  Then there's the eski - we're just not used to taking water etc with us.  I did remember the sun cream and Lauren's sun suit so I can't be that bad as a Mum!  It was absolutely gorgeous we had a huge stretch of beach more or less to ourselves.  We decided to go to a quiet beach rather than heading to the popular resorts the only problem is that the quiet beaches are not patrolled by surf life savers, there are shark nets though.  It just means that people can't (or shouldn't) swim. (some mad Aussies still do!)  I'll ask Daryl to put the photos on.</p>\n<p>Sunday we finally made it to our first expat meet up at the Pig &amp; Whistle English pub in the city.  It was a great set up, we met a few people and will definitely go to the next one.  The people who organise it (I think Gary and Margaret) did a great job making everybody feel welcome.  It was red hot - 32 according to the temp reading near us.  It was so nice.  When we left the meet up we went and had some lunch in a restaurant on the riverside.  Just the way to spend a Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>I'm still waiting to hear about the job by the way so keep your fingers crossed.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>A couple of reasons actually, small but when they add together it's what make this place what it is.</p>\n<p>We got a leaflet through the door saying there would be a collection for garden clippings etc with details on about what size the clippings could be.  All people need to do is leave their stuff in a pile on the path outside their house.  All over the place there were piles of stuff far bigger than the leaflet said they could be, when the garbo's came to remove it all did they leave the big stuff - No they took everything!!!!  I saw one of them carrying a huge log and it just made me smile.   Would that happen in Doncaster? - they won't even take a bag at the side of the bin never mind lump a huge log into the truck.</p>\n<p>Second I had an interview this morning for an admin job at a local boat club, during the interview the woman suddenly stopped talking and said look there.  She pointed out to the marina about 500 yards out from the jetty at 2-3 dolphins were frolicking in the water playing with the boats.  She said they had a wedding here last week and 3 dolphins came right in, it made the brides day.   It made my day seeing them today hopefully they brought me good luck and I'll get the job.</p>\n<p>Lastly when I took Lauren to school a few weeks ago one of the kids was really upset but her Mum really needed to go, the teacher took hold of the kids hand went and sat at her desk and gave her a cuddle.  Within a no time at all the tears had gone and she was sat chatting with the teacher still sat on her knee while the teacher drank a cup of coffee!  Health and Safety?, Risk Assessment?, Child protection?, not a problem if that had been Lauren I'd've wanted her to do exactly that.  </p>\n<p>I love Australia.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It's unusual for me to be posting but Daryl thinks I should.  I walked out of my job on Wednesday.  I've been very disappointed by how things have turned out, I'll explain.</p>\n<p>When I went for my interview John (my now ex boss) explained that for the past few years they had had people running the branch as a franchise but this had not been working and the branch had lost most of the technicians (from 7 to 3) in the last 18 months or so as a result the branch had been loosing money and needed picking up.  The company had decided to bring it back to be a company branch with a manager employed.  He said that as I was new to Australia and no management experience as such he would take me on on a 3 month temporary contract as an administration/operations assistant, acting Branch Manager while I learned the job and he could assess if I would be suitable.  I took the job.</p>\n<p>After about the second week I had been trained in most parts of the job and was going solo managing the branch.  I sorted out all of the filing systems, cleaned the office! and got the branch looking more like an professional office.  When I first arrived I couldn't see how the branch had been running at all there was no wonder they had been loosing money.  There was no organisation and no way anyone could know what was happening day by day.  Most of the equipment was old and didn't work.  To Johns credit he listened to everything I said and if I said I wanted it I got it.</p>\n<p>In my first month I lost another technician (although he said nothing to do with me I must add!) I had 2 techs and enough work for 4-5 so the customer complaints were coming in thick and fast but I dealt with them and we recovered.</p>\n<p>After about 6-8 weeks of my being there John came to Brisbane and asked how I felt things were going, I said I was happy for the time being but if I was to be taken on as manager properly after my 3 months I wanted more money as the job was very stressful and could be very demanding - I got phone calls from 6am to 6pm Monday to Saturday.   He said as far as he was concerned he was very happy with what I had done with the branch and he said he would put a package together for us to discuss and he could see no reason why I wouldn't be made branch manager permanently.   In the meantime I was to introduce myself as branch manager to anyone who asks.</p>\n<p>Over the next few weeks things went smoothly I was trying my best to get more techs but with no luck.  John saw that things weren't looking great and again all credit to him he sent a tech from Sydney to help out.  He was initially supposed to come for 2 weeks then a month (all the time in a hotel) he ended up being in Brisbane for 7 weeks.  Eventually I got a couple of calls from people interested in becoming techs and things stared to look up.  Then another tech left.  When I asked him why he said he didn't want to go into all the ins and outs but said it was nothing to do with me.</p>\n<p>I was left with 1 tech and the borrowed one from Sydney.  Both of which said they loved working for me and things had never been better.  John said the figures were looking really good and said pro-rata Brisbane was number 1 branch in Australia (6 others).  I had got 2 people looking like coming on board within the next couple of weeks and with work coming out of our my ears the branch looked like it had really turned a corner.</p>\n<p>Monday John sent Bernie, another manager, to Brisbane he said to help me out with the new tech interviews and training.  When he arrived he went outside for some fresh air and was on the phone.  I noticed a ute pull up and a guy get out.  He was talking to Bernie then they both came up to my office.  Bernie introduced him as John, someone John (my boss) had met with and had sent to speak to Bernie.  They went off for coffee.  I got a phone call from another manager looking for John.  She had been told John was in Brisbane.  I told her that as far as I was concerned he was due to go to her so must be running late.  While Bernie was out my tech came in to drop off some money and was still there when Bernie and John got back.</p>\n<p>Bernie came into my office and John was in the other room speaking to Craig.  Bernie asked if I knew who this person was as he was confused over the questions he had been asking him.  I said I had no idea.  I went out to speak to Craig and John went into my office.  Craig didn't look happy but I told him to wait till later and I would phone him.  When I got back into my office John asked me if there was anything I would like to change - I asked with regard to what.  He said with the Branch.  He went on to ask me to write a list of things I thought worked well, things that need improving, any ideas I had etc and to treat it 'like a little project' were his words.  I was so dumbstruck I didn't know what to say.  I must have looked like I complete idiot.</p>\n<p>Bernie was due to go to do a quote so John asked if he could tag along I said yes - I just wanted him out of my office so I could phone John and find out what the hell was going on.  His phone was off so I couldn't get any answers.  I was utterly confused.  Craig phoned and asked who the guy was and I said I didn't know but was trying to find out.  Craig said he had said he was coming on as Manager to run the branch.  At this I went from confused to supreme anger!  Bernie came back, he said he didn't know what was going on.  Eventually at about 8.30pm John phoned.  He kept apologising and saying the guy was wrong and that nothing had changed I was still running the show and he had only spoken to the guy about the possibility of him buying into a franchise.  I asked what that meant for me he said that even if he came in it would be on the proviso that I remained.  I said I didn't believe that anyone would buy into a franchise only to let someone else manage it.  John assured me nothing was going to change and I was to continue on exactly the same and to work on the presentation I was due to give at the Managers conference in September.</p>\n<p>Tuesday I went into work as usual.  Wednesday Julia phoned.  (She is the Melbourne branch manager and a fellow expat from Leeds) She asked if I was okay?  I said well I am now but not thanks to him on Monday.  She said oh thank god you know.  I said know what?  I explained about what had happened and what John had said.  She said Oh I've got to tell you he's lying to you.  She said John had actually been in Brisbane on Monday.  He had been interviewing the other John for the franchise.  He had then flown to Melbourne and told Julia about it.  She asked him if I knew about it and he had said no not yet keep it under your hat.  She said she couldn't lie to me and had nothing to loose as she had handed her notice in the day before.</p>\n<p>I couldn't believe what she was saying.  He had completely lied to me.  He had waited till I had built up the branch and made it more attractive as a franchise then pulled the rug from beneath  me 2 weeks short of my 3 month contract.  I phoned Daryl told him, he told me to come home straight away.  I phoned John and told him I was going to leave Friday.  He asked why, I told him I felt I had been used and lied to and completely disrespected.  He said he didn't think he had.  He said I was letting him down walking out in this way and could I at least give him 2 weeks notice so he could advertise for the admin job and give me chance to train the person up.</p>\n<p>Needless to say I packed up my belongings into a box and left that day.</p>\n<p>How dare he even ask me for any help after what he'd done to me.  When I look back now I realise everything he promised was only verbal.  On paper it appears that all I was was an admin worker.  He knew exactly what he was doing and stupidly I fell for it.  Right from the beginning Daryl had said this sounds too good to be true.  It turns out yes it was.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div>A few days ago I wrote about <a id=\"q77y\" title=\"how I'd seen the light in terms of work and lifestyle\" href=\"http://darylandrach.blogspot.com/2007/08/im-starting-internet-business.html\">how I'd seen the light in terms of work and lifestyle</a> after reading '<a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/\">The Four-Hour Work Week</a>' by Tim Ferriss.</p>\n<p>In part 2, before I go on to describe some of the ways that I can generate passive income - the first step towards achieving the dream lifestyle - I'm going to expand some more on the general concept of going from where I am now (which I'm going to call the Lifestyle 1.0 model) to where I want to be (which I'm going to call the Lifestyle 2.0 model).</p>\n<p>I've been using what I've learnt recently to generate my own strategy for achieving my goals. I believe it's important to develop the strategy first, as this will:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce the likelihood of failing at the first attempt; </li>\n<p>\n<li>Give me something to refer back to and provide motivation when things don't got as planned; and </li>\n<p>\n<li>Give me clear milestones that I can use to track progress towards my goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The strategy that I've started to develop is called my Lifestyle 2.0 model. I can't profess that the model is particularly revolutionary; it is something I've developed based on inspiration from 'The Four-Hour Work Week', as well as other books I've read such as '<a href=\"http://www.richdadpoordad.com/\">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a>' by Robert Kiosaki. My model takes the best concepts from these books, tunes them slightly to leverage the 'web 2.0' revolution that is happening right now, and also takes into account my experience and knowledge of risk management gained from my career to date in Information Security.</p>\n<p>The purpose of my Lifestyle 2.0 model is to show how I'm going to use a few basic business and financial principles, as well as a commitment to taking advantage of the web 2.0 opportunities, to help me achieve my goals of gaining financial freedom and escaping the 9-5 so I can pursue my dreams full-time.</p>\n<p>To understand my Lifestyle 2.0 model you first need to understand the Lifestyle 1.0 model. You will easily recognise the Lifestyle 1.0 model because it is what most of us live today. I've split the model into separate sub-models, including a 'cashflow' model and a 'living' model.\n<p><strong>Lifestyle 1.0 Cashflow Model</strong></p>\n<p>This is a basic diagram that I've created of the Lifestyle 1.0 cashflow model that most of us can relate to:</p>\n<p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/50eae-1-cashflow_model.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5101782147336123954\" /></p>\n<p>The Lifestyle 1.0 Cashflow Model is a process flow that determines our financial wealth. The Lifestyle 1.0 Cashflow Model is the model that most of us follow, but also the reason why most of us will never be rich, or at the least will never achieve financial freedom.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our sole income is from a salary. The salary comes from being an employee. The salary is dependant upon us providing x amount of effort and x amount of hours per week. The income we receive from our salary is paid after tax has been taken off.</li>\n<p>\n<li>Most of our income is spent on expenses. Our expenses is made up things such as living costs - bills, groceries, general expenses, etc, - but also payments to discharge our liabilities (debts such as a mortgage, credit cards, loans, etc).</li>\n<p>\n<li>If we have anything left over after expenses we may put this into a savings account. We can count a savings account as an asset because it is working for us - it is generating interest.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>Knowing the difference between an asset and a liability</strong>\n<p>Here's a quick explanation of these terms, which is fundamental to understanding the model:</p>\n<p><strong><br />Asset</strong>: An asset is something that puts money into our pockets. Most of us wrongly consider our house as an asset. In most cases, an house is a liability not an asset because it takes money out of our pockets (mortgage payments, insurance, upkeep, etc). An house is only really an asset if you rent it out to provide an income, or you cash in on any equity that may be in the house, i.e. you sell the house and there's money left over after paying off the mortgage, or you re-mortgage the house to release some equity and you use the released equity to generate income that is greater than the proportion of the expenses inccured from the increase in liability payments (increase in mortgage).</p>\n<p><strong>Liability</strong>: Conversely, a liability is anything that takes money out of our pockets. One of the biggest liabilities that most of us buy is a car. A car loses value as soon as we get into it and continues to take money out of our pockets for as long as we keep it. A common misconception is that a car, like a house, is an asset. It's not because it's not making us any money. Also, unlike an house, a car will never become a real asset because it won't increase in value. A key principle in the 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' book is that rich people put their money into assets, wheras the middle class put their money into liabilities which they think are assets.</p>\n<p><strong><br />Lifestyle 2.0 Cashflow Model</strong>\n<p>This is a basic diagram of the Lifestyle 2.0 Cashflow Model, which I explain in more detail below:</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/072b3-2-cashflow_model.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5101783057869190722\" />\n<div></div>\n<p>Here's how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our income is derived not a from a salaried job, but from 'income generating assets'.</li>\n<p>\n<li>As a business owner, we pay tax after we pay ourselves, and after expenses.  The beauty of being a business owner, rather than an employee, is that we can claim a proportion of our expenses as a business incurred expense.  As an Internet business owner, we work from home, which means we can claim a proportion of our household bills as a business expense.  Because we're a business owner, we pay ourselves the minimum wage so as to only pay the minimum amount of income tax.  The rest of our income from our business is derived from dividend payments.  Of course, we also have to pay corporation tax, but corporation tax is at a lower rate than income tax, and corporation tax only gets paid on profit made after expenses.  Although we pay both income tax and corporation tax, our overall tax burden is actually less than a salaried employee in the Lifestyle 1.0 model.</li>\n<p>\n<li>Most of our income goes back into our assets column.  As our assets grow, so does our income, which in turn grows our assets.  This cycle continually increases our overall wealth.</li>\n<p>\n<li>We buy assets and avoid liabilities.  If we want a luxury such as an holiday, nice car, etc, we make sure it is paid for by our assets.  We must not incur liabilities due to luxuries.</li>\n<p>\n<li>If we do incur liabilities, it is to buy assets.  However, we use risk mitigation strategies to ensure that the income generated from assets financed by liabilities will always be greater than the expense of the liability that paid for the asset.</li>\n<p>\n<li>Although we do buy traditional assets such as property and shares, most of our money goes into creating new Internet business opportunities - we understand that we have the potential to make more money in the short-term by capitalising on this thing that is being called 'web 2.0', than on traditional assets. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>A real asset makes money while I sleep</strong></p>\n<p>In my model, an asset is only really an asset if it makes money for me while I sleep.  A day job is not an asset because it is dependant upon my contribution, both in time and effort, and once I stop contributing, so does the income.  Whereas if done properly, a Lifestyle 2.0 asset will make me money, and then continue to make make me money without requiring any further effort or time on my part - it should be self-generating.\n<p><strong>How do you measure wealth?</strong></p>\n<p>Am I wealthy if my net worth is $1 million.  What about $2 million?  In my model, the measure of my wealth is not how much I am worth in the traditional sense.  In part 1 I suggested that a man earning $250,000 a year but working 80-hour weeks is actually worse off than a man only earning $50,000 but working a ¬º of the time.</p>\n<p>In my Lifestyle 2.0 model my wealth is simply determined by the following calculation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I was to stop working today, how long could I continue with the same standard of living before I would have to work again?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the moment, because I'm living the Lifestyle 1.0 model and have only just begun the Lifestyle 2.0 model, the answer to my wealth question is only a few weeks.  So the success of my Lifestyle 2.0 model will be measured by calculating my wealth in days, weeks, and years, not in dollars.</p>\n<p>That's it for part 2, in part 3 I will describe how my Lifestyle 2.0 Cashflow Model will be used to achieve my Lifestyle 2.0 Living Model.</p>\n",

It's such a difference to the depressing drabness of <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\">Doncaster</span> and <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\">Worksop</span>. </p>\n<p>Brisbane is a city of 1.8 million people, yet because it is spread over such a large area it doesn't feel congested.  As a relatively new city, you can also tell that some kind of planning has gone into the layout.  One advantage of this is that there are lots of parks and green areas. It seems like nearly every street or neighbourhood is separated by a park.  And every house, street and neighbourhood looks different.  It has variety and colour.  You don't drive down a street in Brisbane where every house is the same build and look as in the UK.</p>\n<p>I think our love for Brisbane has helped dampen down any homesickness we might otherwise have had, or should I say what <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">Rach</span> might have had.  I've moved around regularly since I was 16 so I new I'd be <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\">ok</span>.  Whereas in Rachelle's case, up until now she's never lived outside of a 20-mile radius of <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\">Doncaster</span>, so I was worried that she might find it difficult.</p>\n<p>As it happens she's been fine.  Both <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_5\">Rach</span> and Lauren have settled in really well.</p>\n<p>And as for me, it's now nearly 3 months since we arrived here, and although there are people and things in the UK that I miss, I can honestly say I haven't once had any inkling of regret.</p>\n<p>There's no going back!</p>\n",

This was about 3pm.  Little did we know, we'd end up getting absolutely <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\">arseholed</span> and wouldn't end up leaving until midnight.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<p>George's brother and family were over from New Zealand so they were having a little celebration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1071/1102420104_a921406d21_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1071/1102420104_a921406d21_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a>    \n<div> </div>\n<div>   \n<div> \n<div>I'm hoping to get some pics of the night from George's family because by the time the party really started to get wild I was too drunk to remember to take any photos.  In fact, I haven't been that drunk in years.  At one point I had to go to the bathroom and hang on to the walls trying my best not to fall over.  I must have been in there about half an hour trying to sort myself out.  I'm glad I did manage to sober myself up just enough to see out the rest of the evening because it turned into a really good night.  I'm surprised we didn't get complaints from the rest of the complex though.  Our complex is usually quiet but from about 9pm Saturday night were were all stood around the patio heater singing along to Stevie Wonder at the top of our voices!</p>\n<p>While were were drinking and singing outside Lauren was having a ball with her new friends inside.  When we left at midnight we had to drag her away - she was still up partying!</p>\n<p>It's fair to say were were feeling a little rough on Sunday.  We were supposed to go to a pub called the Pig 'n' Whistle in the city for 12pm on Sunday for a BBC <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">meetup</span> (Brisbane British Club), but we couldn't face it.  It's a shame really, as the Pig 'n' Whistle serves <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\">Boddingtons</span> so it would have been the first decent pint I could have had since arriving.  Oh well, we'll just have to make sure we make it to the next one.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On Saturday we had our first experience of 'The Ekka'.</p>\n<p>The Ekka is an annual 10-day event formally known as the Royal Queensland Show.  It was originally called the Brisbane Exhibition but what with the aussie habit of shortening any words over 5 letters it's now known as the Ekka.</p>\n<p>We presumed that the Ekka would be held in in the middle of a park or field, so we were surprised to discover that it is actually held in the city.  A large part of the city is effectively cornered off.  We were amazed by the scale of the event.   There was even a cable car set up to take you from one section of the Ekka to another.</p>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1419/1102433766_8403750a4d_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1419/1102433766_8403750a4d_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />The Ekka is organised by the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland,  so the general theme is 'the country comes to the city'.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1188/1102446194_d9d3c5eafd_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1188/1102446194_d9d3c5eafd_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />All in all it was pretty good but we ended up coming away about 2pm (we got there about 9:30am) as it was so hot.  It was about 28 degrees but it felt like the hottest day since we arrived.  The attractions included an animal boulevard, side shows, agricultural displays, fairgrounds, and a showbag pavilion.  My particular favourite was the Woolworths Fresh Food Pavilion as there were loads of stalls offering free tasters of wine and gourmet food.  I could have easily spent the entire day in there!  It also had cooking demonstrations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1224/1101582451_111a433bdd_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1224/1101582451_111a433bdd_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />We went there mainly for Lauren though.  She seemed to enjoy it.  She got to milk a cow (sign in on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/tags/ekka/\">flickr </a>to see pics), went on some rides, stroked a llama, and came home with some goodies.</div>\n</div>\n<div>   </div>\n<p>The Ekka is also famous for its show bags.  These are bags of items from a particular brand, such as Barbie, Shrek, etc heavily discounted from what you'd normally pay for them.  We bought Lauren a Barbie showbag and Fairy Princess showbag - one of which contained a wedding dress which she wouldn't take off for the rest of the day!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1245/1102504274_40e014f63a_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1245/1102504274_40e014f63a_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />See more of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/tags/ekka/\">our Ekka photo's on Flickr</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ekka.com.au/home/default.asp\">Official Ekka website</a></p>\n",

now living in the location to have the dream lifestyle.<span>  </span>The next step is to actually have the dream lifestyle.</p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">For the last few weeks I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research into the different ways I can use the Internet to make money.<span>  </span>I‚Äôm not talking about a bit of pocket change.<span>  </span>My goal is to make a good living online, giving us financial freedom and liberation.<br /></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span>  \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A lot of ideas have been forming in my head based on things I have learnt from different blogs and podcasts that I subscribe to, and books that I‚Äôve read.<span>  </span>I‚Äôve known for a long time it‚Äôs possible to make good money on the Internet, the thing I‚Äôve been struggling with is exactly <i>how</i>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Which is better: working 80 hour weeks and earning ¬£250,000 a year, or working a ¬º of the hours and earning ¬£50,000 a year but having the complete freedom of when, where, and how to live?</p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I‚Äôve read quite a few books in the past about starting a business, getting rich, becoming a millionaire, etc, but none have had such a profound effect on me as <a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/\">The 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss</a>.</p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/b7e62-4hww.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/245d8070a8.jpg\"

explains the steps he took to build passive income so that he only has to work 4 hours a week.<span>  </span>He spends the rest of his time pursuing things he loves, and some of the things he does with his time are truly amazing.<span>  </span>The beauty of this book is that it explains how you can leverage new systems and business models on the Internet to make money, while only working a few hours of the week.<br /></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> <br />Here are some of the key concepts in the book which I‚Äôll explain in more detail below, I‚Äôll also try and explain how I plan to put the concepts into action:</p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span></p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Build passive income streams</span></li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Eliminate non value-adding work and automate as much as      possible</span></li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Outsource</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Build passive income streams</span></b></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">They key to financial freedom and liberation is to build income streams that make you money again and again, even when you‚Äôre not working.<span>  </span>Like many people, at the moment I make money based on the hours that I work.<span>  </span>It‚Äôs simple: if I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid.<span>  </span>So the key is to develop something that, once developed, does not require my time, effort or even presence to keep it generating revenue.<span>  </span>I‚Äôll get paid when I sleep!</p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Once established, in order for me to reach the goal of having income streams that generate me money without my time, effort, or presence, I then need to take the next step ‚Äì eliminate non value-adding work and automate as much as possible.</p>\n<p></span>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Eliminate non value-adding work and automate as much as possible</span></b></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span></b></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">There‚Äôs quite a lot of detail about this in his book which I‚Äôm not going to repeat here.<span>  </span>I was familiar with a lot of these principles before as I‚Äôve been on a Six-Sigma course, which shares a lot of these principles.<span>  </span>In particular the Pareto principle, i.e. the 80/20 rule.<span>  </span>This is the principle that you generate 80% of your revenue from 20% of your work, so the goal is to concentrate on removing the 80% of your work that doesn‚Äôt generate revenue and build on the 20% of the work that does generate revenue.<br /></span>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This is just one of the principles, there are many more.<span>  </span>Many of which I found I could easily relate to.</p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Outsource</span></b><span lang=\"EN-GB\"></p>\n<p></span>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This was the best revelation for me.<span>  </span>After working for outsourcing companies I‚Äôm more than familiar with how this works.<span>  </span>What I didn‚Äôt realise however, it‚Äôs not just the big companies that can outsource work to India ‚Äì I can and you can too!<span>  </span>There are ‚ÄòVirtual Assistance‚Äô companies established in India and China that you can outsource tasks to for as little as $5 an hour.<span>  </span>You can outsource anything, and I mean <i>anything</i>.<span>  </span>As long as it‚Äôs a task that doesn‚Äôt require their physical presence.</p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.getfriday.com/\">GetFriday.com</a> to see what I mean.</p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">When I started writing this post I didn‚Äôt realise how large it would be and how much I had to write about.<span>  </span>So I‚Äôm going to leave it here and break the rest of the post up over the next few days.<span>  </span>In my next post I‚Äôll explain some of the steps I‚Äôm taking to put these concepts into action,

There are a few accounts that don't make monthly account charges, however these tend to be dependant upon maintaining a certain balance in your account.

				"content_text": "<p>The USS Kitty Hawk is in Brisbane this weekend - on one of the stops on her final Pacific Tour before she returns to be de-commissioned next year.</p>\n<p>Even though the ship wasn't having an Open Day, we drove down to take a look.  Because the Kitty Hawk is a SuperCarrier, it's too big to make it up river in to the City so it has had to berth at a tanker berth at the BP Oil Refinery near the entrance to the river, and the only place we could view it was from the far bank, off the beaten track with limited road access.  Unfortunately, half of Brisbane decided to drive down to take a look as well, which meant we had to crawl in traffic for nearly 2 hours just to get to see her from a distance.</p>\n<p>This is as close as we got...</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1036/868294015_5f1aeb922e_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1036/868294015_5f1aeb922e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a>And this is the best photo I could get zoomed in with my 55mm lens (I'm definitely going to have to buy the 70-300mm lens) ...</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1298/868298105_cb25add017_b.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1298/868298105_cb25add017_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />And this is digitally zoomed in and cut using Picasa</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1079/869144640_f7b51de1d4_o.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1079/869144640_f7b51de1d4_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;\" /></a><br />Still, pretty impressive.  To put it in perspective, I used to serve on HMS Invincible which had a ships company of 1200 and usually carried 12 Sea Harriers and 6 Sea King helicopters.  The Kitty Hawk has a ships company of 4,500 and can carry up to 90 aircraft.  I believe the ones you can see on deck are mainly F/A 18 Hornets.  The Kitty Hawk carries two types of F/A 18's - the F/A-18C Hornet and the F/A-18E Super Hornet (replacement for the F14 TomCat as seen in TopGun).  Not that I'm a Ship Spotter or anything!</p>\n<p>Of course, I've been a lot closer to US carriers in the past as the Royal Navy and US Navy work quite closely together, both on exercises and when operationally deployed.  I just thought Rach and Lauren might want to see it so I let them drag me down there, honest.</p>\n<p>When we got back we had a BBQ for our Sunday dinner - it's a hard life.  I hear it's raining again in England.  Never mind.</p>\n",

After much research, I chose the <a href=\"http://www.teds.com.au/www/6/1001102/displayproduct/1993656.html\">Canon EOS 400D Digital Rebel Xti</a>.  It's only an entry-level DSLR but it will do for me.  Anyway, after a lifetime of operating simple point and click cameras I don't know the first thing about focal lengths, exposure metering, slow-synch shooting, AE bracketing, and all these other wonderful terms.  At least I didn't.  I bought a book earlier this week and I'm just starting to get to grips with the fundamentals.</p>\n<p>I always think it's a waste for these people who buy expensive cameras and only ever use them in the pre-set AutoFocus modes.  I'm determined to learn about the features and digital photography in general.  It came with a standard 18-55mm lens  but as soon as I've got to grips with it I'm going to buy a second lens.  Probably a 70-300mm lens for better zoom.  I know you can achieve better quality if you buy prime lenses set at different focal lengths for different types of shots but that would mean carrying around an heavy bag full of lenses.  Plus, it's not like I'm a sports photographer or wildlife photographer, my photo's will probably cover anything and everything so the two lenses should be ok for me.</p>\n<p>I'm also going to learn how to use Adobe Photoshop properly.  I've seen some amazing photo's that have been enhanced using Photoshop.  I've used Photoshop before but I've never really delved into all the features</p>\n<p>Maybe one day I might get serious about photography, upgrade to a more professional camera and try to make a few bob out of it.  Anyway I'll soon see if the Canon EOS 400D is as good as the reviews say - it's charging at the moment</p>\n",

He's taking up the number 9 shirt left vacant by Robbie Fowler.  If Torres turns out to be half the striker that 'God' was in his prime then we're in for a really exciting season ahead.  Although it was brief, from what I saw of him playing in the World Cup I predict he could become world-class.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>We had Foxtel fitted yesterday.  Foxtel is basically the same as Sky in the UK (both owned by Rupert Murdoch). </p>\n<p>The biggest revelation (they didn't tell us this when we ordered it) is that we can't get Channels Seven or Ten through Foxtel, which is a bit of a bummer because Seven and Ten are two of the main channels that show the programmes we like, such as Lost and House.  We can still watch them by changing the AV mode to Digital or Anologue, we just can't record them.  The reason we ordered Foxtel in the first place is so that we can go back to watching programmes when we want to watch them and forward through the adverts (of which there are far too many in Oz), like we did using Sky+ in the UK.  So it's a bit of a let down.</p>\n<p>Apparently, the reason Seven and Ten aren't available is because Foxtel want to charge Seven and Ten more to carry them over the Satellite subscription than their main rival Channel Nine.  Why? Because PBL owns Nine who also own a 25% share in Foxtel.  So Nine gets a discount.  Seven and Ten are rightly not happy about this so until this is all sorted out I can't watch House at the weekends and forward through the adverts.  I've got a mind to write a strongly worded letter!</p>\n<p>In comparison with Sky, there's not half as many channels on Foxtel, but they have started to trial on-demand programmes, and there is a free Foxtel Active service called Air Active which lets you listen to different music channels which display the song title and artist playing.  HD hasn't launched yet on Foxtel either although I do believe it is due imminently.</p>\n",

If something's a bit of bother, it's a drama.</p>\n<p>I had a 'drama' of my own today.</p>\n<p>A woman fainted on me in the lift today at work, although I don't think it was because she mistook me for Brad Pitt. </p>\n<p>As I was travelling down to the ground floor this woman was the only other person in the lift with me.  Out of the corner of my eye I could see that she looked really groggy like she was about to fall asleep, stood up.  Then suddenly she just fell backwards and collapsed in a heap, hitting her head on a metal bannister in the lift on the way down.  I didn't get to her in time to stop the fall.  As soon as she hit the deck, sick started dribbling out of her mouth.  I immediately rolled her on to her side, worried she was going to choke on her vomit.  Luckily we then arrived at the ground floor and the lift door opened.  I shouted for help and a security guard quickly ran over.</p>\n<p>She was only out for about 20 seconds before she started to come around.  While the security guard went to call an ambulance I tried talking to her to reassure her, and to try and ascertain if there were any other problems.  I also noticed that a puddle had formed underneath her where she had lost control of her bodily functions.  I was particularly worried about her head as it took a nasty crack on the way down.  I checked the back of her head but I couldn't see any blood.</p>\n<p>Once she was able to talk she told me that she wasn't ill.  In fact this was the first time she had ever fainted.  God knows what had caused it.  She was clearly embarrassed about her situation so I asked one of the cleaners to get some towels while the security guard went to find something to cover the lift entrance to give her some privacy while we waited for the ambulance.</p>\n<p>Anyway some of her friends turned up to look after her while they waited for the ambulance so I left them to it.  I wasn't sure whether to stick around or not.  I felt a responsibility because I was the only one with her when it happened but at the same time I'd fully briefed the security guard on what had happened, and that I was worried about the bang to her head, so he could brief the paramedics when they arrived.  With her friends there there wasn't really any more I could offer.</p>\n<p>I didn't get to find out what happened after that but I hope she's ok.</p>\n<p>That's the first time I've had to deal with anything like that.  I'm glad to say I didn't panic and I think I handled it ok.  I received first-aid training in the Navy but luckily it wasn't anything too serious (I'll have to save my tracheotomy training for another day!).  Anyone with common sense would have done the same.</p>\n",

The client I'm working for still hasn't sorted me out a PC or account to access the systems.  Nor do I have a swipe card yet to get physical access to the building.  I have to tailgate in every day, which doesn't say much for their physical security, or their security awareness training for employees as I haven't been challenged once yet.</p>\n<p>The building is pretty nice though:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/0c2bf-dsc00062.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6ce09c7a07.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5081453614380688914\" /></a><br />No one seems to mind that they're paying me to do nothing.  They even keep apologising.  I've been bored to tears to be honest.  Hopefully things will be better next week.</p>\n<p>I scared myself today.  I caught myself saying yip instead of yes, just like the aussies.  I was determined that I wouldn't pick up the accent but I guess it's inevitable when everyone around you speaks differently.  I've already had to adjust some of the terminology I use at work.  For instance here they pronounce the word Router like the Americans do, i.e <span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">row</span><span>ter - row as in 'they're having a row'.  There's a good reason for it though.  Root and rooting, as we poms pronounce route and routing, means something very rude over here.  Dealing with network security every day I obviously have to say router a lot and I cringe every time I say <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">rowter</span>, it just doesn't sound right to me.  Like the yanks they also say <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">darta</span> instead of data.</p>\n<p>I dread to think what we'll sound like in 5 years time from now.  One guy I work with has spent half his life in South Africa and the other half in New Zealand before coming to Brisbane.  His accent is well screwed up.  He keeps talking to me about an application and because of his accent I can't tell whether the application is called Dennis or Dynis.</p>\n<p>I luckily got to spend this afternoon at my employer's office, rather than the client's office where I'm based full time.  It was much better.  They've got a small team of about 20 working their in a cosy office.  Everyone has a laugh and come 4pm they opened up the fridge and started passing around the beers in the office.  It's so nice not having to drive home from work anymore!<br /></span></span></p>\n",

It was particularly strange seeing the picture of the fish lying in the middle of the road on Brightside Lane in Sheffield.  I used to drive down there to work.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"http://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/free-press-news?articleid=2984301\">firefighters are battling to save power supplies in Doncaster</a>, we had our own power outage yesterday.  Shortly after Rach arrived home from work she heard a massive bang outside, and a second later all the power went off.  It turned out a truck hard gone round a sharp bend too fast, about two streets away from our house, and careered straight into an electricity telegraph pole.  The electricity company responded pretty quickly but the damage was that bad it took them a few hours to get the power back on.  When I got home from work we ended up having to go out for dinner as the lights were still out.

There's been level 5 water restrictions here since the 10th April because the dams have been consistently under the 20% mark.

While my French is not that great I at least was able to guess the translation for Control Panel and go in and change the System Locale settings.  I changed everything to English (Australian) and rebooted but it still came back up in French.  I messed around with different settings and the best I could do was get some of the applications to come up in English, but still Windows itself came up in French.  Thinking the procedure might be different for Vista than it is for XP I went on the Microsoft Technet pages and followed their instructions to the letter but still it didn't work.  It must be a bug in Vista I reckon.  There's always problems when Microsoft release their latest and greatest OS.  My advice is to wait until the first Service Pack before you even touch it!</p>\n<p>The other problem I had to deal with was for a neighbour who had just bought a 3G USB modem so he could get online.  Everytime he plugged the modem in to any USB port his computer blue screened.  Again, I didn't have much luck with this (I must be losing my touch).  It was obvious something was causing a conflict somewhere.  I disabled the usual suspects (firewall, A/V, etc) but it didn't make much difference.</p>\n<p>A few years ago I might have spent hours trying to figure both these problems out, as I hate being beaten.

As per usual when I join a company, they haven't got my account set up on the network yet so I haven't got access to the systems to actually do anything.  So I've spent all Friday and Monday reading through technical documentation.  My head is buzzing!

I'm not holding my breath that my accounts will be ready but I should at least be able to take some tasks and get some meetings going with the client to move things forward.</p>\n<p>The project I'm working on is a Secure External Access project.  I've had plenty of experience with this type of thing before but it's a little more complicated this time as it involves 3 different companies sharing a common infrastructure.  So I need to create and implement security policies so that 3 different companies can allow their users to access the network externally over the Internet into the shared infrastructure, but it needs to be completely segregated so users from company A cannot access systems at company B.  What makes it complicated is that there's lots of different components involved and for each component the 3 companies have slightly different requirements and different security models. </p>\n<p>What makes it even more complicated, for me, is that I'm not just helping design the solution and advising on security as I have done in the past, I also need to physically install and configure the different components, and understand how everything works in case there are any problems and I have to provide technical support.</p>\n<p>It's 8:30pm now and I'm ready for bed if I'm honest.  I'm not used to these early starts.  This morning was the first morning when we had the hassle of Rach starting at 6:30 so we all had to be up at stupid o'clock.  Oh how I miss being able to work from home.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>People often tell me that I'm lucky.  I'm starting to believe it may be true.  Things just kind of work out for me.  I have a completely laid back attitude to life - I very rarely get stressed or worry about things.  I take the odd risk now and again and it near enough always works out well.</p>\n<p>Take this emigrating lark for instance.  After selling our house and paying off our large mortgage we didn't actually come here with much money at all.  We had no jobs lined up and no assets to speak of.  We new that without some income it wouldn't be long before we'd start to find ourselves in dire straits.  Yet within just 4 weeks we both now have good jobs, we quickly moved into a nice rental in a nice area, even though many others on BritishExpats.com are reporting that they're finding it a nightmare.  We've sorted out a car, and a school for Lauren with pre-school and holidays child care.  And when it comes to my job things couldn't have worked out better.</p>\n<p>I came out of work today, hopped on the CityCat, and as I was cruising down the Brisbane River slipping quietly under the Cook Bridge passing the riverside mansions on either side, watching the sun set over the city, I couldn't help but smile.</p>\n<p>Normally with contracts, they're paying a large day rate so they expect blood in return.  They usually set deliverables and expect you to quickly deliver, with very little supervision and certainly no training.  They expect you to provide the skills that they are missing.</p>\n<p>In this case, I've been given a project which is highly technical, involving systems that I have very little experience with, and certainly no 'hands-on' experience, even though I was completely honest with them in the interview and told them that the technical side of the project was outside my expertise.  And yet they're completely fine with it.  They're providing me with full training, which will enable me to add a skill to my CV that's extremely sought after in Brisbane, and for which if I was to take a professional course to learn would cost me $$$$, and all they expect in return is a little help with documentation and operational procedures.</p>\n<p>I've even been lucky with the documentation.  The project mirrors another project which has already been completed, and for which full documentation has already been produced.  All I really need to do is amend the existing documentation to relate to the new solution.  I'm struggling to see what's in it for them.  OK, I will be expected to take charge of the solution for two weeks in August while the guy I'm shadowing is on leave, but 6 weeks is more than long enough for me to be fully up to speed with the technical side.  It feels like they just want to keep me on their books.  Fine by me! </p>\n<p>I've felt that guilty at work today being paid to simply learn new skills that I even offered to make contributions that aren't in the project plan - mainly documentation that I would expect if I was the client.  Stuff they hadn't thought of.  They seemed pleased with that so maybe it might delay them coming to the realisation that they don't in fact need me.</p>\n<p>The location where I'm working couldn't be better (unless of course I could work from home).  I'm working out of the client site in one of the big skyscrapers overlooking the river, right across from Eagle Street Pier, and only a 2 minute walk from the ferry terminal.</p>\n<p>This contract might only last a few weeks before I'm out of work again but while it does I'm certainly going to make the most of it.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>We finally returned the hire car tonight.  The company we're buying the car off have gave us a loan car until we return with the bankers cheque and pick up the car which we plan to do tomorrow.  In fact we've been surprised how good they've been.  The car we're buying is only cheap, yet they've been fantastic with us. </p>\n<p>When we decided to buy the car the salesman drove us to the Queensland Transport Office and waited around while we attempted to get our driving licences transferred (we couldn't actually do it then in the end because we didn't have a proof of address with us).  He's also had the car fitted with four new tyres.  We explained that it would take a few days to get the money transferred from the UK so in the meantime he offered us a loan car, even though we told him we had a hire car.  The car he's loaned us, a fairly new Mitsubishi Magna, is better than the car we've bought.  That was on Monday and now it's Friday.  He hasn't rang once to check up on us to see when we're coming in with the cheque.  So all week we've had two cars, which has been a godsend.  Next week is when it will start getting tricky.</p>\n<p>The only problem with our new jobs is that twice a week Rach has to start at 6:30am.  As the pre-school child care doesn't start until 7am that means that I'll have to, with Lauren, drive Rach to work to be there for 6:30 (20 minutes drive), drive back and drop Lauren off at school (another 20 minutes).  Then drive back to take the car to Rach at work (20 minutes).  Rach will then have to come out of work and take me to the ferry terminal so she has the car when she finishes work.</p>\n<p>When she finished work she'll have to drive to pick Lauren up for school and then later drive all way back to near her work to pick me up from the ferry.</p>\n<p>It's only twice a week that we'll have that hassle but I can't see it being long before we consider getting a second car.  It just seems a waste of money having to buy a second car when we'll only really need it twice a week.  Especially when we need to be saving our money for other importing things - like clearing our remaining credit card debt and saving up for a deposit on a house.</p>\n<p>I'm sure we'll get used to it.  It's quite hard at the moment because neither of us are morning people and as it's Winter here we're having to get up in the dark - and it's really cold in the morning.  When the mornings start to get lighter earlier and the weather hots up again I'm sure it won't be a problem.  We'll be up at the crack of dawn even on weekends like all good Queenslanders!</p>\n<p>Anyway we both have Queensland driving licences now.  We bought the maximum 5 year licence.  See how confident we are that we're staying here!</p>\n",

The problem is we haven't properly arranged child care yet.  With both myself and Rach now working 8 hour days we need to arrange pre-school or after-school care.  I also need to go and change my driving licence over to a Queensland licence before I can pick up the car (they're very strict here in QLD).  So I rang them and asked if I can start on Friday instead.  They said that they've already lined up a meeting for me with the client.  We discussed it some more and as they've set the expectation with the client we agreed to a compromise and I'm starting tomorrow afternoon.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure where I'll be based yet - at their main office or the client's office.  If it's the main office where I went today it's slap bang in the middle of the Central Business District (CBD - which is what they call city centres here).  As we live the other side of the river Rach can drop me off at the CityCat ferry point near her work and I can get the Catamaran to work everyday.  Not a bad way to start work each day!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Some good news - Rach went for her second interview (not for the same job) this morning for a Branch Manager position for a Home Services company.  The company provides carpet cleaners, upholsterers, that kind of thing.  She came home from the interview feeling that it went pretty well and after learning more about the role she was quite excited.  This afternoon she got a phone call from the General Manager - she's got the job!!</p>\n<p>It sounds like a great opportunity for her.  Apparently they've had a succession of bad managers over the last few years and they've gone from having 7 technicians to only 3.  Rach has got the opportunity to get the branch in order and build up more business.  It's 35 hours per week, and once she's settled in it's flexible working - she can choose when she does the hours.  It sounds really good.  She starts on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>We've also received an e-mail to say our shipment will arrive in Brisbane on the 13th July.  It wasn't originally due to be here until August.  It will take about 7-10 days to clear customs.  I just hope we don't get stung for import duty.  Apparently they pick shipments at random to check so it's a complete lottery whether we have to pay or not.</p>\n<p>I've been doing a bit of research into some business ideas I've got.  I'm torn between what to do.  I don't really want to back to working for someone else again yet I could do with getting some experience working for a big Australian corporate so I can understand the differences between here and my experience in the UK.  I think the best option would be for me to get a 6 month contract.  This would force me into starting my own company and wouldn't tie me down to a permanent position.  I'd also be able to pursue some of the non-security related ideas that I've got.  I've been exploring some ideas for online magazines and web 2.0 sites.  I could start the magazine straight away but when it comes to the web 2.0 sites I'd need to get up to speed with AJAX which may take some time.  There's plenty of people who are running successful internet business' from home these days - I don't see why I shouldn't be one of them!  Watch this space...</p>\n",

What a life he has lived!  The book was funny, insightful, moving (especially when he is recalling his time in Ethiopia), and also acts as a good historical reference for some of the major events over the last 30 years.</p>\n<p>The book opens with him recalling how he cheated death when an ammunition depot exploded in Addis Ababa in June ‚Äô91, killing 800 people including a colleague of his, and nearly killed him.  This set the tone for the book.  From one war-zone to another; in Sri Lanka, El Salvador, South Africa, Zimbabwe, etc, he faced death on nearly a daily basis reporting for the BBC.</p>\n<p>Although we know him as the face of the Nine O‚Äôclock News on BBC1 throughout the 90‚Äôs, it‚Äôs funny to read how he despised being a newsreader.  He says anybody could do it ‚Äì ‚Äúit looks stressful and difficult but news casting is a doddle... little more than reading out aloud,\". </p>\n<p>The book is a tad too long at 432 pages (in very small print) but it‚Äôs worth sticking with.  His account of the dynamics and changes within the BBC over the years are particularly interesting, but it‚Äôs his insight into South Africa during the last few years of Apartheid, as well as his account of his reporting in Ethiopia during the famine of ‚Äò84/‚Äô84 which set off what was perhaps the largest ever international humanitarian effort, that makes the most compelling read.</p>\n<p>At the end of the book he revisits some of the places where he‚Äôs travelled over the years.  On South Africa, where he spent many years as the BBC‚Äôs special correspondent for Africa, until he was kicked out by the South African regime for reporting the truth, he talks of the contrast between then and now.  His description of South Africa during the apartheid years was just like reading an account of the Nazis during the ‚Äò30‚Äôs.  Like the Nazis, they institutionalised prejudice and racism by writing it into law, effectively making blacks persona non grata in their own country, even though they made up nearly 80% of the population.  Any resistance to the laws, even by foreign journalists trying to report what was going on, was swiftly and brutally dealt with by the vicious army and police.</p>\n<p>On returning, he saw two sides to the country.  He went to the beaches which 20 years ago were whites only.  Now whites, blacks, and Indians happily play side by side.  Yet all this has come at a cost.  South Africa now has the highest rates for murder and rape in the world.  And the country is ravaged with AIDS - it is reckoned that nearly 20% of adults have the disease.</p>\n<p>In Ethiopia, the aid over the years has made some difference.  The difference being that not as many die of hunger now.  They‚Äôre still completely dependant upon foreign aid though.  As he put it ‚ÄúWe seem embarrassed to let them die but incapable of helping them escape this slide into dependence and international beggary‚Äù.  Ethiopia is the largest recipient of relief aid per head in the world, but gets less development aid than any of the needy countries.  The population is growing yet the fertility of the soil is falling; there‚Äôs a disturbing symmetry ‚Äì the population is growing at nearly the exact rate that the topsoil is being washed away off the hillsides, nearly 3% per year.  Obviously this is unsustainable and it can‚Äôt be long before we see a repeat of the tragedy of 84/85.</p>\n<p>This book was published in 2005, before the Live8 concerts and the last couple of years where Africa has been more prominent in the agenda.  Yet it seems to me that unless we get major reforms of the World Bank and IMF we‚Äôre unlikely to see any real improvement in our generation.</p>\n<p>From my review of this book you may think that it‚Äôs fairly maudlin and a difficult read.  Not so.  Yes, he does recall in great detail many accounts of war, death, and destruction.  But there‚Äôs also many funny stories as well.  Like the time he got locked out of his hotel room stark bollock naked!</p>\n<p>If I take anything from this book, it‚Äôs an even greater admiration of the BBC.  At a time when the world is dumbing down, and after the American news networks have all but abandoned reporting on foreign news, it‚Äôs good to know that there‚Äôs one broadcasting organisation in the world that continues to maintain impartiality and integrity, and report on issues that matter, not just what the ratings analysts think we want to watch.</p>\n",

When we came over in January there were tons of opportunities but I've hardly seen any this month.  I'm just hoping it will pick up in July with the start of a new financial year and new budgets for IT departments.</p>\n<p>In fact, the end of financial year is quite significant here as most of the shops have 'end of financial year sales' on.</p>\n<p>Rach went for her first interview yesterday.  She says it went well although in total  they were interviewing 20 people for the role so she's not holding her breath.  It would be great if she got it though as it's a marina and shipyard - she might be able to get us discounting mooring fees for our future yacht (I suppose I ought to get a job first - little details!).</p>\n<p>We've also sussed out the car market.  We extended our hire car for another two weeks hoping that I maybe able to start work so we can afford something better.  We originally decided to budget ¬£2k for a run-around until I started work.  The plan being I'd get a good job with perhaps a company car, or we'd buy something decent, and Rach could use the run-around.  The problem is you can't get anything here for ¬£2k.  Because of the climate, cars aren't prone to rust and other types of deterioration like they are in the UK so don't depreciate as much.  </p>\n<p>It looks like we're going to have to increase our budget as it doesn't make financial sense to extend the hire car much longer.  The hire car is due back next Wednesday so we're going to look around at a few cars over the next few days.</p>\n<p>We bought Lauren her first bike today.  Pink, of course!  Where we live now in a gated community is the perfect place for her to learn to ride. It has got stabilisers on for now (although it still didn't stop her from falling off and banging her knee).  I'll give her a few days to get used to it with them on before I take them off and teach her to ride properly.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>We had our first taste of aussie sport last night watching the annual State of Origin.</p>\n<p>The State of Origin is an annual set of 3 Rugby League matches between 'the maroons', representing Queensland, and 'the blues', representing New South Wales.  It's one of the main sporting events of the year and the aussies take it very seriously, especially here in Queensland where they're passionate about Rugby League.</p>\n<p>It's called State of Origin because players are selected to play for the state in which they played their first professional rugby match.  So in some cases club players actually get to play against each other in the State of Origin match, much like Premiership club players get to play against each other when they're representing their country.  The first match was played in Brisbane on the evening we arrived here (Queensland won), with the second match last night played at the Telstra stadium in Sydney.  We watched it on telly at home but we could have gone down to South Bank Parklands where it was being shown on a big screen.  Before last night's game, the stats showed that competition was surprisingly close over the years, with New South Wales winning 38 matches and Queensland winning 39.  More extraordinary still, the points difference was 1260 to 1261.  </p>\n<p>Anyway, in the end Queensland won 10-6 last night making the third game, to be played in Melbourne, academic.  Being good Queenslanders we were cheering on the maroons of course, although they don't know how to say maroon here, they pronounce it morone for some weird reason.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>After a couple of days of torrential rain and then an unusually cold day, we‚Äôre finally back to business as usual ‚Äì clear blue skies and warm sunshine!</p>\n<p>You might have seen on the news that a cyclone has hit New South Wales, including Sydney, and killed a few people.  I think we caught the edges of it here.  In fact we couldn‚Äôt believe how cold it was yesterday.  The houses here aren‚Äôt prepared for cold weather; they‚Äôre built to keep the inside cool and many, including ours, doesn‚Äôt have heating.  Well I think it might have, just we haven‚Äôt figured out how to get it working.  The A/C unit is supposedly one of those reverse cycle ones where it can kick out warm air but whatever setting we tried it just seemed to be set to ARCTIC.</p>\n<p>Today couldn‚Äôt have been more different.  It was like a different season never mind a different day.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs Queensland Week this week, and with this weekend also being a long weekend due to a public holiday on Monday for the Queen‚Äôs birthday (funny how there‚Äôs a public holiday for it here yet not in Britain), there‚Äôs loads of stuff happening all over Brisbane this weekend.</p>\n<p>Today we started off by going to the Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre on the South Bank for what was billed as the world‚Äôs largest second-hand book sale.  There were over 2 million books for sale, starting for as little as 20 cents.  We bought a stack of paperbacks and hardbacks, some fairly new, including DVD‚Äôs for a total of only $50 (¬£20).</p>\n<p>We then drove over the river to Roma St Parkland where they were holding the Big Queensland BBQ.  It‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôve visited the Roma St Parkland and we were really impressed.  It contains the world‚Äôs largest urban sub-tropical garden ‚Äì and it‚Äôs absolutely beautiful.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/awardsevents/events/queenslandweek/Big_Queensland_BBQ/\">Big Queensland BBQ</a> was completely free and there was plenty to see and do (besides eat of course).  Lauren loved it.  Hi-5 were performing on the main stage, and all around there were tents with different acts and fun for the kids.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/7dca5-img_0038.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fcc72ddae7.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5074385510924800034\" /></a><br />More new photo's on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/\">flickr</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the things I love about this country is that there are always things happening, places to go and things to see, and most of the time it‚Äôs completely free.  Today, even the parking was cheap.</p>\n<p>In other news‚Ä¶ (this is the BBC from London).. Rach has got herself a couple of interviews lined up.  One next week and one the week after.  They‚Äôre both for office manager type roles.  I‚Äôve proposed the idea of her working full time and me staying at home, writing a best-selling novel or working on my perpetual motion invention, but she‚Äôs having none of it.  At least if she does get a job it takes the pressure of me a little and will at least pay for the roof above our head.  What I‚Äôm starting to realise here is that because everyone‚Äôs so laid back, everything takes ages to sort out.  In the UK, I‚Äôd submit my CV for a job in the afternoon and then be following it up with a phone call to the agency the next morning.  It doesn‚Äôt work like that here.  It seems it takes them a week just to check their e-mail.</p>\n<p>Patience my dear boy..</p>\n<p>We went out for a drink last night at ‚Äòour club‚Äô with our new neighbours Paul and Julie, from Coventry.  Paul drove and parked his car underneath some trees brimming with Lorikeets.  When we came out the car was absolutely covered in bird shit!  It was that bad he had to take it through the car wash there and then, and even that didn‚Äôt get it all off.  We did laugh!</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm getting the hang of the language by the way.  It‚Äôs simple.  You just abbreviate everything to the first 3 letters and then add an o.  For instance, your car registration over here is rego, an ambulance is ambo, etc (you get the picture).</p>\n<p>I also love some of the shop and brand names over here.  I particularly like Coon Cheese and the bedding company - Holy Sheet.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I'm finally up and running on broadband again.  It wasn't straightforward though.  I went back to 3 on Monday with all the necessary I.D.  They spoke to their accounts department and explained my situation.  In the end the accounts department just needed some proof of recent income.  So I had to go to the Carina Leagues Club (henceforth known as \"my club\") to use their <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\">internet</span> room, which has a free printing service when you purchase the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\">internet</span> card, and print off proof of my income from contracting over the last few months.  I took the paperwork back to 3 and eventually, late Monday, I got a phone call from them to say their accounts department had accepted me.  Thank god!</p>\n<p>I took the new broadband data card home Monday evening and of course - it didn't work.</p>\n<p>I rang their technical support line who told me I had to wait 24 hours for the service to be activated.  So I waited and tried again late Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Come Tuesday it still wasn't working so I rang them again.  They told me that the web surfing package had not been activated on my account, they would activate it now but I'd have to wait between 4 and 24 hours before I could use it.  So I waited again.</p>\n<p>I kept trying all morning and nothing.  I rang them up this afternoon and would you believe it, just as I started talking to them I got a blue flashing light on my data card to show their was a network available.</p>\n<p>I'm all up and running now, finally, and what's more I'm getting a decent speed - nearly 1Mb.  I've also got a 2<span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">Gb</span> allowance which is twice what I had with <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\">Telstra</span> although not nearly enough for me to download music, <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\">podcasts</span>, or movies; or watch Liverpool <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_5\">FC</span> matches streamed on <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_6\">Liverpoolfc</span>.<span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_7\">tv</span>, or even use <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_8\">Skype</span> with my <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_9\">webcam</span>, etc.  I could, but that would eat up my allowance in less than a week.</p>\n<p>Funnily enough, at just about the same time as my mobile broadband started working, so did my <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_10\">landline</span>.  We're now up and running on a home phone number so will be calling home over the next few days (we promise not to call in the middle of the night, honest!).</p>\n<p>I've just had a call from a recruitment consultant who told me he's working on setting me up an interview with a large security consultant, possibly next week.  It doesn't sound like they're recruiting at the moment but he said they were interested in my CV.  It could be one of those where they set me on on the basis that I go out and win some business for them.</p>\n<p>On Monday we got ourselves enrolled for Medicare.  Hopefully, when I'm working full-time we'll be able to top this up with private medical insurance.  I still need to read up on how it all works but from what I understand we use our Medicare card to claim back a percentage of any medical fees incurred.  Medicare covers 75% of the schedule fee for in-hospital services, 85% of the schedule fee for out-of-hospital services, and 100% of the schedule fee for out of hospital GP attendance items.  However, the schedule fee is a fee for service set by the Australian Government and not necessarily what the doctors may charge.  A lot of people have private medical insurance here to cover the remaining fees.  In fact, the federal government penalises those that haven't.  According to a government website:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lifetime Health Cover is essentially a financial penalty imposed on people over the age of 31 who do not have hospital cover. If a person does not have hospital cover on 1 July following their 31st birthday and decides to take out hospital cover later in life, they will pay a loading of 2% on top of the base premium for every 1st July that has occurred since their 31st birthday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It looks like it's going to be a bit more expensive for me.</p>\n<p>By the way, the heavens have truly opened on Brisbane.  It started pelting it down late yesterday afternoon and it hasn't stopped raining since - 24 hours of non-stop rain.  The locals are loving it as there has been a drought here for months.  I can't say we share their joy.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>All was going well with the new wireless broadband <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\">USB</span> adaptor for my laptop up until Friday when I broke it!  All I did was pull it out of the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\">USB</span> port and the thing came apart on me.  I took it into the shop I purchased it from Saturday morning and they told me they couldn't replace it there, I'd have to ring up <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">Telstra</span> and ask them to send me a replacement.  So I rang up <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\">Telstra</span> and eventually get through (the phone services over here are even worse than in the UK, even worse than <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\">BT</span> in fact) only to be told I'd have to wait 5 days for a new one.  That's completely <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_5\">unacceptable</span>, I can't afford to wait 5 days especially while I'm looking for work.  Anyway, I told them to cancel my account.  And I took the adaptor back to the shop and got my money refunded.</p>\n<p>I was back to square one - no <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_6\">internet</span>.  I then went in <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_7\">Vodafone</span> to sign up for one of their packages but of course I didn't have my passport with me or any other form of identification that they would accept.  By this time the shops were shutting up so I knew I'd have to wait until Sunday.  So I went back this morning with I.D. and applied for the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_8\">Vodafone</span> package, only to get refused because I failed the credit score.</p>\n<p>They weren't very helpful at all.  I explained the situation - it's hard to pass the credit score when I've never had credit in Australia and when I haven't yet got a job.  I told them I was willing to pay for 12 month usage in advance but they weren't having it.</p>\n<p>I then made my way to the 3 shop to give their package a go.  They have different rules and couldn't accept the passport - they needed to see something with my current address on, and it can't be the tenancy agreement.  The thing is, we haven't had any bills yet to our new address so I thought I was stuck.</p>\n<p>I went home extremely frustrated to say the least.  Anyway, luckily, our first bill arrived today for electricity.  So I'm going to try again tomorrow.  It could still be a problem though with the credit check.  I explained to them that while I haven't sorted out employment yet I'm still officially a director of a UK company so hopefully that could be taken into consideration.  I guess I'll find out tomorrow.</p>\n<p>So to summarise, I still love Australia but they really need to sort their telecommunications out.  I'm still without a <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_9\">landline</span> - we've been told it will be fixed on Wednesday.  It took us days to activate our mobile <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_10\">SIM's</span> because <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_11\">Vodafone</span> was going through an IT upgrade that seemed to last a week (I don't think much of their change control!).  I can't get <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_12\">ADSL</span> to the house, and I'm not having much look with wireless broadband.</p>\n<p>Besides that everything else is good.  <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_13\">Rach</span> did a good days work yesterday.  She was originally only going to work in the morning helping set up for a wedding reception but she got asked back in the evening to help out.  I'm not sure if she'll be doing it again though.  She didn't mind setting up, or even helping the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_14\">soux</span> chef in the evening, but she draws the line at washing pots.  I don't blame her - we're not that <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_15\">desperate</span>.  Yet.</p>\n<p>I'm typing this from the Carina Leagues Club, which we've just become members of.  Think Phoenix Nights but less Northern UK.  The beer is cheap, so is the food.  There's a live band on (sorry, 'turn'), and there's a kids club for Lauren.  What more does anyone want from life!  I'm going to have to get to grips with the language though.  I asked for a beer and they asked me whether I wanted a skooner or a pot.  Pot sounded larger so I went with that.  I got an half!  Skooner is the pint glass.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>So much for the broadband order being processed and activated 10 days after Thursday.  After speaking to a neighbour last night (who incidentally has recently moved her from Coventry), it seems that there's no more ports available on the local telephone exchange for ADSL broadband and they're not likely to upgrade capacity for another year.</p>\n<p>I rang Optus this morning, the ISP who I had registered with asking them to clarify.  They told me they had no way of checking this until my phone line is activated on Thursday and the application begins processing.  So I then tried ringing Telstra Wholesale who are responsible for the phone line, but their switchboard just kept putting me through to the ISP.  Twice.  Even though after the first time I specifically told them I didn't want to speak to the ISP I wanted to speak to the people who are responsible for exchange.  When finally they did put me through to the right number I was left in a queue for at least 30 minutes before I gave up and put the phone down.</p>\n<p>I tried looking on the web via my phone but I couldn't get a web connection.  After speaking to Vodafone (I can't even be bothered to go into the problems we've been having with Vodafone Aus over the last few days) it turns out that may PAYG package doesn't include web.  So I had to purchase an 'Extras pack'.</p>\n<p>I tried navigating to the Telstra Wholesale pages on my phone but it was like pulling teeth so I gave up in the end and we drove to our local shopping centre to use the internet kiosks.</p>\n<p>Anyway it turned out that yes, there are no more available ports on our local exchange, and the same is true of much of Brisbane due to the massive growth it is experiencing (probably due to the thousands of Brits that are descending here at the moment).</p>\n<p>There's no Cable in this area either so that left me with only one choice - 3G data card.</p>\n<p>At least I'm up and running on the internet now from home, even though I am restricted to 1Gb per month usage and the maximum speed I can get out of this thing is 200kbps - half the speed of basic ADSL.  It's ok for surfing the web but I guess I have to forget bit torrent downloads for a while.  I also need to test Skype as I'm not sure if I have enough bandwidth to make VoIP calls back home, never mind using the webcam that we purchased before we left so our parents can regularly see Lauren.</p>\n<p>If I'd have known this was the situation with broadband beforehand I probably wouldn't have signed the tenancy agreement, I would have looked elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Oh well, I'm sure I'll adapt.</p>\n<p>Besides that, everything else is good.  Mind you, we had our first day of rain today - they didn't put that on our visa!</p>\n<p>We've nearly finished putting the house together, only one more bedside table to put together.  I've also applied for a couple of jobs.  I'll ring round the agencies tomorrow to suss them out.  I'll also catch up on my e-mail tomorrow and reply to those of you who have e-mailed me.  Sorry I haven't replied yet.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Well we're in the new house now.  We've made the major purchases and everything we ordered has been delivered.  Yesterday we bought a nice new telly and a few other things like a hoover, ironing board, kitchen stuff, etc.  Our fridge, freezer and washing machine came today.  We've also been given a form to claim back $200 off our washing machine as it's a front-loader.  There's still a lot of top-loaders in Australia so there's a government scheme to incentivise people into purchasing front-loaders because they're more environmentally friendly.</p>\n<p>Our phone line is being connected on Thursday, but I have to wait 10 days after connection until broadband is activated.  Gutted.  It's making things very difficult not having broadband.  I suppose I can at least use dial-up when the phone line's connected on Thursday.  I'm typing this at a shopping mall near where we live as Rach does our first big shop - at Woolworths of all places.  Woolworths is one of the big supermarkets here, although I've been reliably informed that it's not the same woolies as on the high streets in blighty.  She told me as it's the first food shop and everythng is different here she's likely to be in there at least 2 hours.  I've promised to join her after an hour - 2 hours in a supermarket is not my idea of a good time even if everything is 'new'!</p>\n<p>We seem to have spent most of the last 2 days building flatpacks and shopping.  There's still a load to do, the house is upside down.</p>\n<p>I plan to start looking for a job tomorrow. </p>\n<p>Besides that everything is great.  The sun has shined every day since we've been here - 25 degrees.  It's forecast to be 27 deg next week even though we're getting towards Winter!  The area where we live is absolutely beautiful.  We're next door to parkland and there's the Bulimba Creek (river) very close where you can apparantly canoe up to the main brisbane river.</p>\n<p>I'm still pinching myself that we're actually here.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I got up at 4:30. I had already planned to do this because I wanted to be in Fortitude Valley to watch the Liverpool v AC Milan Champions League Final. Someone had told me on BritishExpats.com that I‚Äôd be able to find at 24/7 Sports Bar in Fortitude Valley in Brisbane which would be showing the match.</p>\n<p>Having never been to Fortitude Valley before I wasn‚Äôt fully sure where I needed to be but I looked all around there and could I heck as like find a sports bar that was open. There were a few restaurants that were open at that time in the morning, strangely enough, but no sports bars.</p>\n<p>I quickly jumped back in the car and headed back to Cath‚Äôs as I new it was being shown on terrestrial TV on SBS. Why didn‚Äôt I just get up and watch it on the telly in my wangers in the first place rather than venturing into Brisbane in the middle of the night trying to find a sports bar! It was about a 20 minute drive back to Cath‚Äôs so I searched the radio waves trying to find a radio channel where I might be able to listed to the match while I was driving. I did find a channel, but unfortunately the commentary was in Italian. I couldn‚Äôt believe it, I was in Australia and the only radio channel that I could listen to the match on was in Italian!</p>\n<p>I was pretty pissed off (with myself) but I figured that at least I‚Äôd make it back to catch the second half. However, I had made another fundamental mistake. I had assumed that we were 10 hours ahead of the UK as last time when we visited in January, but I didn‚Äôt take into account British Summer Time. So we were in fact only 9 hours ahead. Meaning I got back just in time to see AC Milan score their second goal 10 minutes before the final whistle. Liverpool lost and I went back to bed. I‚Äôm strongly considering following Aussie Rules football from now on!</p>\n<p>Later that morning we went into Brisbane CBD (Central Business District (city centre)). I opened a bank account with Bank of Queensland. This was pretty straight forward and only took about 20 minutes, as opposed to the 40 minutes it took when I went into Worksop to close my Barclays account before we left the UK. We also went to a Starbucks where I got online and applied for a Tax File Number for me and Rach. A TFN is like a National Insurance number in the UK and is needed for everything in Australia. We also had a quick search for rental houses and wrote down a few numbers to arrange a viewing for the following day.</p>\n<p>Cath made us a lovely meal in the evening with an obligatory bottle of wine. We were still jetlagged though and in bed asleep for 9pm.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I haven't posted for a few days as it's been a bit hectic emigrating and all that.  I'll try and catch up now starting with our stopover in LA.  Also, I haven't had chance to upload the photo's yet so I'll update this post with our photo's in a few days...</p>\n<p>We started our first day in LA with an American breakfast at Mel‚Äôs Diner in Hollywood ‚Äì famous as being the location for much of American Graffiti starring Ron Howard, amongst others (although I believe most of that footage was actually shot in a studio, not the diner itself).  My breakfast included French Toast which I‚Äôve never had before ‚Äì it was lurveleeey!  Rach and Lauren had ‚Äòa stack‚Äô (pancakes).  Not very healthy I know but when in Rome and all that.</p>\n<p>We spent the rest of the morning taking in some of the sights of Hollywood.  We had a walk up and down the Walk of Fame looking at the celebrity stars.  We went to the Foyer of Mann‚Äôs Chinese Theatre to look at the hand and footprints of the likes of Gregory Peck, Tom Hanks, etc.  We also went in the Hollywood Wax Museum and Guinness Book of World Records.  The Hollywood Wax Museum was basically a second-rate Madam Tussauds, and the Guinness Book of World Records was a poor relation to the one that used to be housed in the Trocodero in Piccadilly Circus in London.  A bit of a let down really.</p>\n<p>The Walk of Fame was full of ‚Äòlook-alikes‚Äô, some better than others, along with people trying to sell you tours and hip-hop artists trying to get you to listen to the CD they‚Äôve created in the hope that they‚Äôll be discovered.</p>\n<p>Hollywood has supposedly been cleaned up in recent years but it still seemed quite dirty and tacky to me.  The same can be said of LA in general.  I don‚Äôt think I once saw any street cleaners the whole time we were in LA.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon we went on a couple of guided bus tours, taking in the ‚Äòhomes of the rich and famous‚Äô as well as some other sites such as Hollywood Bowl and some of the film studios.  Again this was all a bit of a letdown really.  Most of the tour around Beverly Hills and Bel Air involved looking at large gates and trying to peer through trees to see a corner of a roof of a Hollywood star‚Äôs home.  As for the Hollywood Bowl, ok I appreciate that it‚Äôs the largest naturally configured concert venue in America but it‚Äôs not half the size of Milton Keynes Bowl even, and it‚Äôs still only a stage and rows of seats.  I can‚Äôt image wanting to go on a tour of Sheffield Hallam Arena so I‚Äôm not really sure why Hollywood Bowl is a tourist attraction.</p>\n<p>We also drove around some of the movie studios.  Well actually we drove past the front door of buildings that used to be famous as being the home of movie studios.  Most of the big movie studios are actually no longer in Hollywood, they‚Äôve moved down to the San Fernando Valley.</p>\n<p>Why did we feel that we were always getting ripped off?</p>\n<p>Another thing that got on our goat was the obsession with tipping.  I appreciate that many in the service industry get paid pittance so work off tips but it has got ridiculous in LA.  For instance on the tour bus not only was there a big sign saying tips are appreciated (after already paying more than it‚Äôs worth for a crap tour), there was even a guide to how much we should tip.  $10 for an OK tour, $20 for ‚Äòwill come again‚Äô, etc.  I didn‚Äôt see anything saying we could get our money back if we thought the whole tour was overrated!</p>\n<p>I must have spent a fortune on tips.  For instance you‚Äôre supposed to tip the porter $1 per bag.  We had 7 cases.  It‚Äôs not like he had to individually carry them all up to our hotel room.  I even helped him put them on the trolley.  They‚Äôre not subtle in their quest for tips either.  They went as far as standing in front of us with their hand out before they left the room.</p>\n<p>The one that had me flabbergasted was on Santa Monica Pier.  There was a street entertainer that was doing some kind of balancing act.  We started watching as he did his piece and then before he would continue he made it known to everyone that he expected his tip in advance.  He stood their and even pointed people out who where standing in the audience and yet hadn‚Äôt tipped, saying ‚Äòif you want to watch show you must tip‚Äô.  I think he was Korean.  Can you imagine that in Covent Garden ‚Äì the street entertainers asking for money before they did their show?  I thought sod him and started to walk away but Rach reined me back because Lauren wanted to watch the show.  So I begrudgingly put a dollar in his bucket.  His show was crap, I‚Äôm sure anyone could have done that after just half an hour practice.  I should have put my hand in the bucket and reclaimed my dollar!</p>\n<p>Anyway I digress.  At the end of the first we were absolutely exhausted so had an early night.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2<br /></strong><br />We spent day 2 down by the beach.  The day didn‚Äôt start well.  When you look at a map of LA things don‚Äôt look that far apart.  This is deceiving because actually LA is enormous; it‚Äôs a huge sprawling area of disconnected areas that make up greater LA.  To give you an idea, Sunset Boulevard alone is 28 miles long.  After figuring out the distance to Santa Monica from Hollywood we realised it would be expensive in a taxi so we‚Äôd try public transport.  We worked out we‚Äôd have to get 2 buses.</p>\n<p>We must have waited at the bus stop for half a hour before giving up.  I thought sod it and went back to our hotel lobby to get a taxi.  The taxi was roughly $50 and took about 25 minutes.  Actually, if it takes 25 minutes in a taxi imagine how long it would have taken getting 2 buses.  We would have spent half the day travelling there and back.</p>\n<p>On arrival at Santa Monica we started out on the Santa Monica Pier.  This was one of the best bits of the trip.  Think Skegness Pier but much larger, less dirty and tacky, better weather and a better view!  The view down the coast and the view out to the Pacific was spectacular.  We spent a couple of hours on the pier taking in the sights as well as taking Lauren on some rides in Pacific Parc ‚Äì a fairground on the pier.</p>\n<p>On leaving the pier we then headed off to find a bus to take us down to Venice Beach.  We had a long walk before we eventually found one.  It was a really hot day and it wasn‚Äôt long before Lauren was moaning that her feet were hurting her. </p>\n<p>Venice Beach was packed, not the beach itself which was largely empty, but the promenade.  There were hundreds of stalls set up, mostly selling hippy paraphernalia.  We walked along the Venice Beach promenade down to Marina Del Rey.  Actually, we didn‚Äôt reach the Marina itself.  We stopped short and went for a meal at a local fish restaurant, after which went and had a hour on the beach.  We hadn‚Äôt brought our swimming cosy as no one in their right minds goes swimming in the Pacific in May.  We did dip our toes though.  The water was freezing!</p>\n<p>We then took a taxi back to the hotel.  Another $50 plus tip of course.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>\n<p>We spent the Sunday at Disneyland.  Again, the day didn‚Äôt start well.</p>\n<p>We bought tickets from the Hollywood tourism office the day before along with what I thought was a reservation on a tour bus for the 3 of us to get there.  Apparently it would have cost us approx $80 each way in a taxi.  They recommended that we either hire a car for the day or they could book us on one of the tour buses at a reduced rate.  Not wanting to drive in LA we decided to book the seats on the bus.</p>\n<p>We walked around to the pick-up spot on the Sunday morning to go to Disneyland.  We stood their for a while next to the tour ticket booth and after realising we were the only ones there we thought we ought to double check that the bus is on time.  We spoke to the tour operators and they told us that the bus was full and had already left.  It turned out that we didn‚Äôt have a reservation after all, it was a referral.  What we should have done was contact the tour operator straight away after purchasing the Disneyland tickets and booked seats on the tour bus.</p>\n<p>We were stumped.  We walked around looking for a car rental agency but being a Sunday they were all closed.  So we made our way back to the hotel to speak to the concierge to see if she could help.  It was only then that we noticed there was a Hertz rental desk in the hotel.  The concierge tried ringing the tour operators for us to see if there were any other buses that we could get a seat on.  No luck.  So in the end we had to hire a car after all.  As we were leaving the next day we figured we might as well hire the car for 2 days ‚Äì returning the car to the airport the next day.</p>\n<p>The original plan was to be at Disneyland before 10am.  By the time we got the hire car (we must have spent at least half an hour in a queue) it was already gone 10am.  That‚Äôs when the fun began.  Not having the American maps for our Tom Tom, and with the hire car we hired (a Ford Taurus) not having SatNav we had to rely on the old-fashioned method ‚Äì maps.</p>\n<p>Normally this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if I was navigating (being a bloke of course), but as Rach refused to drive in L.A. the driving was left to me and the navigation was left to her.  We headed off in what we thought was roughly the right direction looking for a sign to the nearest freeway.  I kept calling out street names and avenue names to Rach but she couldn‚Äôt seem to find any of them on the map (to be fair the maps that Hertz gave us were pretty crap).  I had a rough idea that we were heading west towards the coast so I figured we just needed to turn south to be heading in the right direction.  Unfortunately before we new it we was surrounded by skyscrapers smack bang in the middle of downtown LA.  We carried on through and out of downtown LA, still looking for a freeway, and drove through one of those areas that tourists really need to avoid.  We couldn‚Äôt believe it, it was just like in the movies.  The sidewalks were littered with black homeless people with shopping trolleys full of their possessions. There seemed to be gangs and druggies all over the place ‚Äì it was like Boys ‚Äòn the Hood.  It was one of those places that you definitely shouldn‚Äôt stop and ask for directions.  Rach was papping herself.  I must admit I did step on it a bit, expecting to be carjacked any second.</p>\n<p>We eventually found the freeway.  I was driving along the freeway for about 30 minutes, putting my complete trust in Rach that she was navigating us in the right direction, when we came across the turn-off for Malibu.  Now I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm all that familiar with LA but I was sure that Malibu was north of LA, whereas Disneyland is in Anaheim which is south of LA.  We were on the right freeway, it was just we‚Äôd been travelling in the wrong direction for half an hour!</p>\n<p>We realised our mistake, turned around and eventually made it to Disneyland ‚Äì for 1pm!</p>\n<p>Disneyland was ok, but it didn‚Äôt seem to be half as good as how I remembered Orlando, Florida when I visited a few years ago in the Navy.  It just didn‚Äôt seem to be as spectacular ‚Äì there weren‚Äôt half as many shows or big rides as I had expected.  The other problem was that it was really busy.  If it was that busy on a Sunday in May I dreaded to think what it would be like in the middle of the school holidays!  We queued for the first couple of rides but after that we really couldn‚Äôt be bothered.  There was no way we was going to queue 60 minutes for the big rides - which last all of 60 second.  Lauren was moaning after queuing for 10 minutes, and even when we eventually made it on to the rides she didn‚Äôt particularly like them.  She told me that she doesn‚Äôt like rides that are fast, dark, loud, that turn, spin, or go up and down - which pretty much rules out all the rides.  We did find a few that she enjoyed ‚Äì that we all enjoyed in fact.  They were the jungle cruise where you go on a river boat through a ‚Äòjungle‚Äô and see lots of animals and tribes on the riverbanks and in the river.  It was pretty impressive.  The special effects were good and the animals were quite lifelike.  We also all enjoyed the Buzz Lightyear ride where you get to control your car and shoot things at the same time.</p>\n<p>The day ended with a spectacular fireworks display set to music which was very impressive and worth the entrance money alone.  Not sure it was worth all the hassle in the morning though!  Only problem, by that time Lauren was absolutely exhausted and was falling asleep towards the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4<br /></strong><br />We had the hire car for our final day and with our flight not leaving until 9:30pm our original intentions was to make the most of our last day and see more of the sights.  But we were that exhausted after Disneyland that we couldn‚Äôt face it.  Our feet were killing us so we decided to just hang around the hotel until it was time to leave for the airport.</p>\n<p>Getting to the airport involved more fun and games.  We found the airport pretty easily but it was a different matter finding the place we had to return the car to.  We followed the signs for rental returns but we missed the sign for Hertz completely and ended up on another freeway taking us away from the airport. </p>\n<p>LAX is massive.  As such the place where you drop off your hire car is about a mile away from the terminals.  When we did find it they had there own fleet of coaches to take you to the airport.</p>\n<p>It was a bit confusing at the airport as they do things slightly different to what we‚Äôre used to when we‚Äôve travelled in other countries.  For a start, when we went to check-in, we got our luggage checked in but then had to take them over to another part of the building to put through security, rather than the bags being whisked away straight away on the conveyer belt at check-in.  Once we got rid of the bags at security we then had to go out of the building and then into another building adjacent to it for us to go through security.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we made it in good time and boarded our flight to Auckland, New Zealand.</p>\n<p>We had a 12 hour flight to Auckland, one hour at Auckland and then boarded our final flight to Brisbane.<br /> Crossing the International Date Line in the pacific immediately put the clocks forward 24 hours and meant that we left LA on Monday evening and landing in Brisbane on Wednesday morning.  For us, Tuesday never existed.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>We've spent most of today shopping for our new house.</p>\n<p>We went down to IKEA first thing, arriving for opening time at 9am.  The IKEA in Brisbane is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere and is absolutely huge.  What's more it was pretty quiet and quite an enjoyable experience, unlike the last time I visited the Leeds IKEA!</p>\n<p>We managed to pick up a bed for Lauren (which she chose herself) along with decent mattresses for us all (no good buying a cheap matress if you value your sleep!), a coffee table and other bits and bobs.</p>\n<p>We got back to our new house at lunchtime to await the delivery of our new bed, which arrived on time just as they had said.</p>\n<p>We then went to Cannon Hill Shopping Centre in Brisbane to look for a fridge/freezer and washing machine.  We managed to pick these up at what I think is a really good price after a bit of haggling.  The Salesman welcomed us with open arms and quickly told us he is Welsh, from Cardiff, even though he has lived here for 25 years!</p>\n<p>We also bagged ourselves a real bargain.  We had no intentions of getting a Dining Table set yet but we saw one we loved on a Manager's Special.  It's a dark wood table with 6 dining chairs with Suede back, and what's more the whole lot only cost us $499 (2 hundred British pounds (I'm going to have to work out how to input the British Pound symbol from these Ozzy keyboards)).</p>\n<p>We returned at 5pm to our new house to await delivery of the Sofas which again turned up on time.</p>\n<p>So far, touch wood, everything in Australia has been a breeze.  The people are fantastic.  Everyone is friendly and can't do enough to help you.  It must be the sun.  It's so uplifting waking up to clear blue skies and glorious sunshine every morning.</p>\n<p>It's quite funny really.  It has been about 25 degrees each day while we've been here but the ozzies have been moaning that it's cool while we've been sweltering.  Some are even wearing coats!</p>\n<p>Anyway, this looks like being our last night at Cath's.  She's been great letting us stay her (again) and I know Lauren's loved it playing with Bonnie and their dog Lucy.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow's going to be another busy day building our bed and other flat pack furniture, while we're awaiting our IKEA delivery.  We're also going to have a look for a telly.  I very nearly bought a 40 inch Plasma with built in HD tuner today but I decided to be sensible.  We may have made quick decisions so far with everything else but I'm not taking any chances with a telly, I'm going to have a good look round.</p>\n<p>I suppose I also ought to think about looking for a job so I can pay the rent on our new house in the coming weeks!</p>\n",

We loved the second place we saw, put in an immediate application, paid the bond and picked up the keys that afternoon!</p>\n<p>It's a 3 bedroom house on a gated community in Carina - a really nice part of Brisbane.  We've got a garage (with remote control electric door and everything!), a separate laundry room, en-suite master bedroom, the second bedroom has got it's own balacony, fitted kitchen with dishwasher, the lot.  There's a shared pool near enough next door to our house along with a BBQ area.  Only problem - it's unfurnished.</p>\n<p>After picking up the keys we immediately headed down to Capalaba to a couple of furniture stores we had been recommended.  Within the 2 hours we had before they closed we managed to buy a really nice sofa (or lounge as they call them over here) and Queen size bed.  We actually got 2 sofa's - one 3 seater and one 2 seater, both in Coffee coloured suede fabric.</p>\n<p>I'll post photo's when it's all set up.  We managed to get free delivery for the sofas to be delivered the next day.</p>\n<p>We stayed another night at Cath's and managed to stay up until 10pm this time!</p>\n",

We're all absolutely exhausted after a long weekend in LA, much of which wasn't that great if I was honest.</p>\n<p>Disneyland was pretty good yesterday, although we nearly never made it (more about this later), and we enjoyed Santa Monica pier, but the rest of the experience was generally overrated and disappointing.  I haven't got time to go into now as the battery on my laptop is about to run out and Rach has packed away the travel adaptor in one of the cases, which are in storage until we head off to the airport later today, and I can't be bothered to go searching for it.</p>\n<p>Next stop Brisbane!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I'm pleased to say we've safely made it to L.A. with all 7 cases.  I admit it was a bit of a nightmare yesterday.  Why oh why did we take the train and not get a hire care or taxi (my fault)?</p>\n<p>I'm just glad we made the decision to get the earlier train.  We left Retford at 9:30.  The train arrived into Kings Cross 9 minutes late (no surprises there).  We then had to queue for about half a hour for a taxi.  It then took another half hour just to make the 2.8 mile trip over to Paddington Station, crawling in heavy traffic.  It wasn't even rush hour - so much for congestion charging.  From Paddington, we took the Heathrow Express to Heathrow central station.  We then had about a 10 minute walk to Heathrow terminal 3.</p>\n<p>When we got to the airport we were very surprised to find that there were no queues for check-in.  We got checked straight in (relieved to get rid of the suitcases) and proceeded to Security.   Unfortunately, the reason why there were no queues at check-in was because everyone was already queuing at Security.  It must have took us nearly an hour to clear.  It was really hot and stuffy, with little or no air conditioning.  One of the walk-through detectors was broke which added to the delays.  Everyone was extremely pissed off to say the least.   One guy lost his temper and started shouting at the officials, as they seemed to be standing around not doing anything to make things go quicker.  I'm surprised he didn't get shot - you know what they're like at airports these days after 9/11.</p>\n<p>Once through we went to TGI Fridays for some lunch, seeing as though it was Rachelle's birthday.  We were in there for about an hour, and then came out to find that our plane was already boarding - an hour before take off!</p>\n<p>The flight was ok.  I took about 11.5 hours (for some reason I thought it was going to be 13).  The plane had a video on-demand service with plenty of the latest films.  I watched Music and Lyrics with Hugh Grant which was a bit cheesy but funny nonetheless.  Rach also watched Freedom Writers which she said she enjoyed.  Lauren must have slept for at least 5 hours.</p>\n<p>One of the best bits about flying to America for me is flying over Iceland.  The view is absolutely spectacular.  I took these two photo's with my camera phone (in Flight Mode of course):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/72143-dsc00038.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/654423802c.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5065893802774934434\" /></a><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/7c925-dsc00037.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a7c2e8b489.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5065894382595519410\" /></a><br />After arriving at L.A. we got a taxi to our hotel.  I got slightly worried after about 20 minutes into the journey because we seemed to be heading into really rough areas, with no signs of Hollywood or downtown LA to be seen.  I guess I've watched too many films but I imaged us being taken into some rough area like Inglewood and then robbed by some Mexican family.  Anyway, we made it safely to our Hotel.  It took about 40 minutes and cost roughly $50.  After checking Google Maps this morning I don't think we were taken advantage of.  The route that he took looks about right.</p>\n<p>As I'm typing this it's now 06:45.  We've all been awake since 4am.  Damn jetlag!  We've woken up to find L.A covered in fog (or is it smog), and there seems to be a giant Elephant outside our window.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/56009-dsc00045.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c272a51f01.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5065900133556728770\" /></a>The hotel seems ok so far.  Wireless internet in the rooms, most importantly, as well as a good coffee maker and large TV with loads of channels (shame about the wall-to-wall adverts though).  Not that we're planning on spending much time in the room.  We've got a fun packed 4 days planned.</p>\n",

That's going to be fun and games tomorrow getting to Heathrow.  I thought it would be fun (for Lauren) to get the train instead of  getting a hire car down to Heathrow.  That's a decision I'm sure I'll regret tomorrow.  Us and our 7 cases will be getting a taxi to Retford train station, then the train to Kings Cross, another taxi across to Paddington, and then the Heathrow Express to the airport.  I suppose we could have made it even more of an adventure and decided to get the tube to Heathrow but I'm not that much of a sucker for punishment!</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how I feel. I should be excited about our first trip to LA tomorrow and then on to Oz to start our new life, but at the moment I just feel a bit numb - the last few days have been a whirlwind.</p>\n<p>Rach is sat on the settee still sobbing after just saying goodbye to her family.  They came over to spend an hour with us.  It was purposefully short - neither Rach or her Mum could have stood it any longer, it was heartbreaking.</p>\n<p>I'm glad we're doing this now while Lauren is only 5 and she doesn't really understand the enormity of what we're doing.</p>\n<p>So that's it.

This morning we went up to see my Grandma in her care home.  She's 91 and has dementia so can't even remember who I am.

It always amazes me how Bawtry has managed to turn into such an upmarket village given it's position halfway between Doncaster and Worksop.</p>\n<p>It was a fantastic night, and a very emotional one.  I think every one of us was crying at some point in the evening, myself included (especially when the bill arrived!). </p>\n<p>It finally hit me last night what we are doing.  It was my mate Michael's toast that got me started.  It suddenly hit me like a sledgehammer that we were in fact saying goodbye.  Of course we're going to keep in touch with everyone, and with the Internet, e-mail, Voice over IP phones, and the like, the world has truly become a smaller place.   But it's not going to be the same.  There was a brief moment last night when I questioned what we're doing.  How did we arrive at this point?  And then I remembered the beaches, the sun, the sound of the Kookaburras in the morning, the 'shrimps on the barbie', the paradise which is North Stradbroke Island, and the countless opportunities for sport and exercise. </p>\n<p>I know we're making the right move.

I can't say I'm going to miss Doncaster, or Worksop for that matter (where I'm originally from and where we're staying now with my parents).  I concede that under the Labour government's tenure there has been vast improvements in our cities, but the same can't be said of our towns.  There's a world of difference between going on a night out around Manchester or Sheffield compared to Doncaster or Worksop.  Worksop in particular seems to have gone seriously downhill since I left in 2000.  I may sound like a bit of a snob but I can't believe the amount of waif and strays wandering the streets, never mind the druggies.</p>\n<p>A night out on the town will be a little different in Australia.  There certainly doesn't seem to be the same yobbish binge drinking culture.  Listen to me, I used to be part of that culture, especially when I was in the Navy.

There are some people on britishexpats.com who admit to leaving the debts with no intention of paying them off.  I'm too honest for that, and too practical - what if it all goes wrong in Oz and we have to return?</p>\n<p>We also still need to set up an Oz bank account and a money transfer account.

I can't wait to see her face when we get there!</p>\n<p>I don't know which I'm more excited about - emigrating or our stopover in L.A!</p>\n",

It's important that they look at this from the perspective of what it would mean<br />to the business if the data was lost, disclosed or changed, based on worst-case scenario and irrespective of the likelihood of it happening or the security measures currently in place to prevent an incident.  At this stage we need to understand the possible impact of a security incident, not the risk of an incident occuring - the likelihood and current mitigating security controls will be taken into account in the next stage.</p>\n<p>(I also followed this up with a telephone call to ensure the RM clearly understood what I was asking for)</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">RM to Me</span>: Please see the attached completed BIA</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Me to RM</span>: Thanks for that but can you please ask the client to amend the BIA to reflect the value of their data and impact of it being lost, disclosed or changed, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">without </span>considering the likelihood of an incident occuring <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">or</span> the existing security controls in place.  They've put in the summary notes that they have based their conclusions on the fact that they haven't had an incident in the past year (to their knowledge) and they have processes in place to mitigate the risk.  Again, at this stage we're not considering existing security controls because we purely want to know the possible impact to the business in terms of financial loss, reputational damage, legal/regulatory penalties, customer impact, etc (as per the template) if the data was lost, disclosed or changed - we need to know the value of the data not the risk of an incident occuring.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">RM to Me</span>: I added in the extra comments - not the business.  we just tried to add some common sense to the process - i.e. how the system actually works.

Again, this is the Value not the Risk, whereas the value would be all red, the risk value, taking into consideration existing controls and the likelihood of an incident might bring it down to Amber or Green, but at the moment I just need to know what it would mean to the business if their data was lost, disclosed, or changed, not the likelihood of it happening.</p>\n<p>Finally the Relationship Manager understood what I was asking (even though I talked her through the process on the phone at the beginning and she made out that she understood).</p>\n<p>You need a lot of patience for this job!</p>\n",

For a while now, I've been using <a href=\"http://www.listal.com\">www.listal.com</a> to catalogue our DVD's and books - mainly DVD's up until now.  But as we're shipping all our books we made the effort to inventory every single book prior to packing them - coming to a grand total of 597!  Listal makes it easy though.  All you need to do is enter the ISBN number off the book and it fills in all the details for you by interrogating Amazon.

The room is clean, but there doesn't seem to be any way of getting rid of the stench of stale smoke, short of re-painting the walls and replacing all the soft furnishings.  On the first night I emptied an entire spray can of Oust into the room, covering everything - ceiling, walls, carpet, curtains, bedding, the lot.  The effect lasted for about 10 minutes before the stench began to fill my nostrils again.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a particularly strong smell, but it is there - it is noticeable, and it is bugging me!</p>\n<p>I've tried each night to move rooms but I seem to have chosen a week when everything is booked solid.

So not only do smokers have to go outside, they have to smoke away from the entrance so we don't have to walk through it when entering or leaving the building.<br /><a href=\"http://www.health.qld.gov.au/atods/tobaccolaws/index.asp\"><br />Full details are here</a></p>\n<p>I went on a stag weekend to Dublin shortly after the ban was introduced there and it was so nice to be able to go out on a drinking session and wake up the next morning not smelling of smoke.</p>\n<p>The Wetherspoon chain of pubs in the UK has already made 146 of its 673 pubs non-smoking, and many of its other pubs have non-smoking areas inside.  I used to think Wetherspoon pubs were crap because they don't play music, but now being a thirty-something I actually find it quite nice to be able to have a pleasant conversation (cringe!).</p>\n",

They didn't give out any intelligence or operational information, and they're supposed apologies were edited and taken out of context by the Iranian propaganda machine.  No they weren't tortured, but those who have been through torture say that the psychological pressure can be just as bad as physical torture.</p>\n<p>I hope those sad little columnists in the papers, who have never served a single day in the armed forces, are thoroughly ashamed of themselves.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>In 1996 Electric cars began to appear on roads all over California.  They were quiet and fast, produced no exhaust, and ran without gasoline.  10 years later these futuristic cars were almost entirely gone.  What happened?</p>\n<p>This is the question that is addressed in the award winning documentary '<a href=\"http://www.sonyclassics.com/whokilledtheelectriccar/\">Who Killed the Electric Car</a>' recently released on DVD in the UK.</p>\n<p>The website for the film makes interesting reading so I'll definitely be checking out the DVD.  It seems the technology is there, has been for a long time, and is fit for purpose, contrary to what the motor industry tells us.</p>\n<p>The charge is made that the motor industry, in cahoots with the US federal government and the big oil companies (mainly Exxon Mobil) launched a successful campaign to kill off the electric car.  But why?</p>\n<p>The oil companies interests were obvious: they wanted to kill off anything that may reduce the need for fossil fuels.  As for the US federal government, there links to the oil companies are well documented.  But what about the car manufacturers?  It seems most of the profit generated by the car manufacturers actually comes from maintaining and replacing the internal combustion engine.  A transition to batteries would have been a disaster for the profit/loss sheet.</p>\n<p>Yet again another documentary which shows how the world is being killed by the greed of big companies.  I personally believe this is systematic of the market capitalist economy we rely on.  Some people argue that it's exactly the market capitalist economy which will save the world.  As climate change affects us more, the market will act to correct prices which will reduce demand for fossil fuels and put more pressure on companies to develop alternatives, which will in turn lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions.</p>\n<p>This is a dangerous assumption.  Yesterday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released it's second report of the year which yet again gave a unanimous declaration by the world's leading climatologists that global warming is happening, and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">is</span> a result of human activity.  Scientists also agree that we are quickly approaching the point of no return.  Can we afford to wait for market corrections to kick in?  I doubt it.</p>\n",

As much as I believe it's everyone's responsibility to take action, I don't want to stop taking flights when the opportunities arise, and I would very much like a 50 inch Plasma TV please.  The fact is, whatever we do in Britain, it will make no difference unless the attitudes of American and China (and India, Brazil and others) change.  Our carbon output is a fraction of theirs.</p>\n<p>It seems like the government and the media in this country have finally woken up to the real and present threat of climate change.  It's about time!  It's even starting to become cool to be a tree hugger.  What I hate though, is the amount of hypocrisy involved.  The BBC, Guardian and others keep preaching to us every day about green issues, but what are <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">they </span>doing to combat climate change?  Same with the Government.  They're quick to bring in green taxes but what are the ministers doing personally?  I can't see the ministerial car changing to a Toyota Prius.  And what are they doing to force industry into making changes?  Why aren't they forcing building companies to build more carbon neutral homes?  Why aren't they banning the use of traditional light bulbs and forcing everyone to buy energy saving bulbs, like they're starting to do in Australia?  Why aren't they putting more pressure on the motor industry to produce more hybrid cars?  Why aren't they putting tax on aviation fuel?</p>\n<p>For me and Rach, living in Australia will probably reduce our carbon footprint (our heating bill will certainly go down!).  Up until we fly back to visit the family in the UK that is, as one long distance flight can apparently blow your entire carbon calories.</p>\n",

We've been very cautious up to now to not start putting any plans into action until we've exchanged contracts, because we know the house sale could fall through at any moment.  However, their visit gave us a lot of confidence that the sale would go through ok; they were clearly very excited about the purchase, frustrated that things weren't moving any quicker, and agreed to purchase a number of items.  So I think it's fair to say that we would be very unlucky if things fell through. </p>\n<p>With that in mind, and taking into account what could be an extremely short period between exchanging contracts and moving out, we're not going to wait any longer - we're going to start selling items this week and we're going to start packing next weekend.

That doesn't mean to say there aren't any IT Security jobs in Brisbane, there are - they're listed on <a href=\"http://www.seek.com.au\">www.seek.com.au</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jobserve.com.au\">www.jobserve.com.au</a>, there's just not as many as in the other cities. </p>\n<p>I'm also getting the picture that the agencies aren't quite as efficient as the ones in the UK.  Apparently in Oz many recruitment agents don't see it within their role to keep you updated - you have to chase them - constantly!</p>\n<p>The general consensus is you're either lucky, and pick up work straight away, or you'll end up applying for about 100 jobs and have to wait 4 months before landing one.  I just hope it's the former, because if it gets to 4 months I'll be starting to twitch and Rach will be in full-blown panic mode!</p>\n<p>Contracting doesn't to be as lucrative either, so it looks like I may have to go back to being a permie (heaven forbid!), and permanent rates don't look that attractive either.  Oh well, money isn't everything.</p>\n<p>No seriously, it is standard of living, not income, that counts.  All I'll need in Oz is a bit of petrol money to get down to the Gold Coast every weekend, or up to the Sunshine Coast, or over to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehainesfamily/tags/northstradbroke/\">North Stradbroke Island</a>.

There's no such obligations for UK companies.  Unless of course you count the 2006 Fraud Act which gives banks (not retail companies) the obligation for reporting losses due to fraud involving payment cards (however many banks know that they can easily get around this).</p>\n<p>There's the Data Protection Act of course, but the Information Commissioner is pretty toothless.  You don't hear of companies being fined ¬£1 million by the Information Commissioner, like <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/Library/Communication/PR/2007/021.shtml\">Nationwide was last month by the FSA</a>.</p>\n<p>From my experience, companies only implement good security controls if they've either been impacted by a security incident which has cost them a lot of money, or they've been audited by a regulatory board or client and have been forced to improve security.  It's shocking to see the lack of protection around customer information in retail companies.  Many retail companies don't even have any standard security monitoring devices on their network or servers, so for all we know, our information could be being disclosed every day and the companies aren't even aware of it, never mind us, their customers.</p>\n",

Well I'm sure some people did, but no one in my office did put it that way.  Then after about an hour there was a new news item on the corporate Intranet to say that Granada Report was broadcasting live from our building for their usual 6pm slot on ITV.</p>\n<p>Then about mid-day, lots of police with sniffer dogs turned up outside the building, and lots of other official looking people were milling about outside and in the lobby.</p>\n<p>It wasn't until about 3pm that word got round that TB was visiting.  There was then another news item confirming it on the Intranet, saying that the Granada Report broadcast would be a live Q&amp;A with Tony Blair, focusing on the work-life balance, which the company I'm working for is supposedly a leading advocate of.</p>\n<p>It was all very exciting!  Well, not really.  I didn't even get to see him in the end.  I was on my phone standing in the lobby when one of the security guards asked me to clear the area.  Just as I was walking back into my office I heard the police sirens as the motorcade turned up.  A massive entourage then quickly walked past my office, which I presume TB was in the middle of, but I never saw him.</p>\n<p>Anyway it turns out my office wasn't just on Granada Report, it was also on the main ITV News as they did an interview with him prior to the Granada Report broadcast.</p>\n<p>As I left the office I walked straight past the motorcade and thought about taking some pictures, but bottled it because of all the police and what looked like Close Protection Team.

I'm sure devolution in Northern Ireland could have been a lot more advanced by now if it wasn't for the pig-headedness of Ian Paisley.</p>\n<p>It can't be a good thing to have a Reverend as First Minister when Religion is the cause of the troubles in Northern Ireland.  If the objective is unification through changing attitudes and culture, surely the best step that could be taken is to remove religion from politics altogether.  Especially when, according to a survey conducted by Dr Peter Shirlow of the University of Ulster, segregation has become more of a problem - growing since 1994.</p>\n<p>So the ultra-Protestant Ian Paisley will have an ex terrorist Catholic for a Deputy, and a cabinet brimming with Catholic ministers.

				"content_text": "<p>Last Thursday, while walking down to Tiger Tiger, I was approached by a scruffy looking bloke who asked me if I could spare him 11p.   My default reaction was to say 'sorry, I don't have any change'.</p>\n<p>Now the reason I bring this up is because I've got to the section within the book 'Join Me' where the reader eventually learns the point of Join Me, which is to make the world a better place by carrying out random acts of kindness (incidentally, the author has only just decided on the point of Join Me a third way in to the book, even though he has already recruited hundreds of members to the 'Collective', and spent lots of money getting leaflets and stickers printed to market Join Me).</p>\n<p>Anyway, on retrospect I should have given the scruffy looking bloke 11 pence and not even have thought twice about it.  It was 11 pence for god's sake, it wouldn't break the bank.  But why was saying No my default reaction?</p>\n<p>Well, I didn't actually say No.  Instead, I told him I had no change.  In fact, I went even further, and told him that I had no money on me whatsoever and was looking for a cash machine.  Why I felt the need to elaborate in this way I don't know.  Especially when I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">did </span>have change on me, and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">wasn't</span> in need of an ATM.  The nice chap then proceeded to point me in the direction of a cash machine around the corner.  So off I went, around the corner towards a cash machine I didn't need, in the complete opposite direction to where I wanted to travel, just so he wouldn't see through my blatant lies.  I even had to wait around the corner for a minute hoping he'd move on before I could turn around and go back in my original direction.  How sad!</p>\n<p>If I analyse my actions, I guess I could use the excuse that my reaction was automatic 'learned behaviour' after years of living and working in large towns and cities where the police advise everyone not to give money to <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\">beggers</span> because they will use it to fund their drug and alcohol addiction.</p>\n<p>Now I'm no drug and alcohol expert (although I could be the latter if expertise is based on consumption (in my Navy days, I'm sensible now)) but I'm sure you cannot get much heroin, or even Special Brew for that matter (or is it <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\">Buckfast</span> these days?), for 11p.</p>\n<p>Looking back, he obviously wasn't even a tramp.  He was just some scruffy bloke who was 11 pence short of his bus ride home.  He probably wasn't even that scruffy, he just happened to have a beard, looked a bit rough, and was asking for money.  So I put two and two together and came up with five.</p>\n<p>It's fair to say I feel ashamed of myself, especially after I vowed to say <a href=\"http://darylandrach.blogspot.com/2007/03/high-on-life.html\">YES more after my epiphany reading 'Yes Man'</a>.  I wasn't the only one saying no that day.  While I was walking away I heard him ask at least a dozen more people if they could spare 11p, all of whom gave him the brush off.  That in no way excuses my actions though.</p>\n<p>I'm not halfway through Join Me yet but it seems to me a bit like the film 'Pay it Forward'.  The interesting thing about Pay it Forward of course being that the end ultimately brings you back to the point of cynicism because his (Haley Joel <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">Osment's</span> character) final act of kindness - sticking up for his friend - leads to him getting stabbed to death.</p>\n",

I think the reason I like his books so much is because like him, I enjoy stupid pointless things, and believe things which may at first seem to most people like stupid pointless things, can actually turn into life changing, or at least life affirming experiences, as his books show.</p>\n<p>When we drove up to the Sunshine Coast while in Oz, we passed an attraction called The Big Pineapple. We never actually stopped to see what this is, but now I know (it's part of the story in 'Yes Man') that The Big Pineapple is one of many 'Big Things' dotted around Australia. Now some people might think how pointless, but I think it's great, and I vow to visit all the Big Things when we move to Australia. <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\">Rach</span> is not aware yet of this wonderful adventure I have planned for us but I'm sure she'll have as much enthusiasm for it as me.</p>\n<p>There's even a website for the Big Things - <a href=\"http://www.bigthings.com.au/\">http://www.bigthings.com.au/</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">I was going to post a photo here of The Big Pineapple, one from the many available on the Internet.

The Big Things pictures will commence when the journey begins.</span></p>\n",

Here's some of the facts that are starting to emerge:</p>\n<p>Gordon Brown claimed that 4 out of 5 households would be better off because of his budget, yet leading accountants say this is impossible to prove because of missing information which includes:\n<ul>\n<li>The level of income at which basic-rate tax will become payable from 2008-2010</li>\n<li>The level of salary above which National Insurance is payable for that time</li>\n<li>Increases in personal allowances for people under the age of 65 from 2008-2010</li>\n<li>When higher-rate tax becomes payable in 2008-2009</li>\n<li>Details on who is able to claim working tax credits or child tax credits and how much</li>\n<li>Levels of inflation the Treasury has assumed for its figures</li>\n<li>No commitment to provide this information in next week's Finance Bill, which will only cover tax changes in 2008-2008</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's clear that the people who lose out most from this budget is single people with no kids on less than 18k, which, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, equates to 2 million people.  The loss is due to the abolition of the 10p starting tax rate, and the fact that they can't claim child tax credit to claw back the difference.</p>\n<p>The other losers in the budget is people like myself - small business owners, because the Corporation Tax rate is rising from 20 to 22p for small companies, yet coming down for large companies.</p>\n<p>All in all it's a very strange Budget for a Labour government.  So much for looking after the poorest in society and encouraging entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>And so much for the green measures - is ¬£400 road tax really going to deter those who can afford a ¬£50k Range Rover?</p>\n<p>The Sun made itself look stupid, while other papers were taking a cautious reaction to the Budget, the Sun rejoiced with this headline:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/8b66a-sun220307.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e76be4f221.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5045461800520858658\" /></a>Surely, The Sun's core readership must be those low earners who will actually be worse off?</p>\n<p>Touch wood, none of this will affect me, as we'll be long gone by the time the changes start next April.  The state of politics in this country is one of many reasons why we're fleeing down under.</p>\n",

We had to do some 'activities' before we could get stuck into the bar.  You know, the usual stuff: forming circles so you get to meet everyone else who is working on the project; brainstorming inputs into the processes; identifying disconnects.  Actually it was quite a laugh and it turned out to be useful.

Turns out they were waiting for the release of the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">Playstation</span> 3 at midnight tonight:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/52322-dsc00135.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fee24340b0.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5044872947619675154\" /></a><br />I don't know how long the people at the beginning of the queue had been there but even so, from the time I took this picture they had another 6 and a half hours to wait.</p>\n<p>I went in and had a look at a demo of the PS3 and fair enough, it does look good.  But is it really worth standing in line for hours on end just so you can be one of the first to get your hands on it?  It's not as if they're going to be in shortly supply - Sony aren't predicting any shortages.</p>\n<p>In fact, it's the Nintendo <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\">Wii</span> that's in short supply apparently.  I bought <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\">Rach</span> a <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_5\">Wii</span> for <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_6\">xmas</span>.  I was really lucky, I just walked into a Game shop and managed to pick up one of the last ones in stock.  She loves it, she's addicted to playing <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_7\">Wii</span> Smooth Moves at the moment.  Personally I love <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_8\">Wii</span> Sports - it makes me feel like I'm playing competitive sports even though I'm not leaving the living room.  At least the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_9\">Wii</span> gets you up of your arse and actually involves moving body parts other than your thumbs!  I get a sweat on getting beat up playing boxing with my 5 year old daughter - she is rather good, and I hate losing!  I know I should let her win, but it's not in me.  That's what makes it even worse when she beats me.  How embarrassing getting beat by a 5 year old girl!</p>\n<p>I wouldn't buy a PS3 on principle.  ¬£425 - that's taking the piss.  Why do we always get ripped off?  It's much cheaper in America and Japan.  Not only that, the European version for some reason is not fully backwards compatible.  Sony say they cannot be certain that all the old games will play on the new platform.  Note this is only a problem with the European version.  Why do consumers put up with it?  Oh and of course the PS3 has been available in the rest of the world for months now.</p>\n<p>I'm not fond of Sony because of this and other reasons.  I don't like the way they make everything proprietary so you have to stick to their standards and products.  Like you have to use a Sony memory card - you can't use a SD card.</p>\n<p>Saying that, I wish I was more principled.  I've got a Sony <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_10\">Ericsson</span> phone and a Sony <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_11\">PSP</span>.

				"content_text": "<p>Like many, I've downloaded the templates off Martin Lewis' site <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/\">moneysavingexpert.com</a> to try and reclaim unlawful punitive bank charges over the last 6 years.  I worked it out, and after having a bad year 4 years ago when I kept hovering around my overdraft limit, I racked up approx ¬£1100 worth of unauthorised overdraft charges.</p>\n<p>After sending them a letter demanding it back, with interest, I came home this weekend to find I've received a settlement offer from them which states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>May I say how sorry I am to learn that you feel the bank charges you have incurred are unfair.  In you correspondence you have referred to elements which you feel support your claim.  Barclays is aware of the information you have drawn to our attention.  I must inform you, however, that we disagree with your view.</p>\n<p>When an account is opened with us, our customer is provided with a copy of the Terms and Conditions relating to the use of their account; including details of our charges.  This information clearly explains our obligations to our customer, as well as their obligations to us.  If we make any changes to the Terms and Conditions, we provide details of these changes to our customers in line with the Banking Code.  Details of our Terms and Conditions, along with our charging tariff, can be obtained at any of our branches, or via our internet site, www/woolwich.co.uk/barclays.co.uk.</p>\n<p>Despite my comments above in relation to your views, on this occasion, and without any admissions of liability, I am willing to offer the sum of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">¬£860.00</span> towards the total amount you are seeking.  This is with the cost and inconvenience inherent in a further dispute in mind and is intended as a gesture of goodwill, in full and final settlement of your complaint.  If you would like to accept my offer please sign and return the enclosed form in the pre-paid enveloped provided.  I will arrange for the payment to be credited to your account within seven working days of receipt of your acceptance at this office.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, shall I accept or stick to my guns and hold out for the full amount?</p>\n<p>I've had a look through the advice posted in the forums as well as the main articles on moneysavingexpert.com, and my conclusion is this:</p>\n<p>Most of the success stories on moneysavingexpert.com state that they were either offered the full amount in the first instance, or they rejected the first offer, started small claims court proceedings, and then the banks quickly paid the full amount.  However, there is an Office of Fair Trading (OFT) ruling expected within the next couple of weeks that could change the situation.</p>\n<p>The OFT are due to make a ruling on unfair bank charges within the first few days of April, and are likely to say the banks should be charging no more than ¬£12, even though in actual fact independent experts agree that it costs the banks no more than ¬£4.50.  My charges were initially ¬£20 and then rose to ¬£25.  I've worked out the mean average and it's roughly ¬£22.  Which means, after the OFT ruling, the banks will likely only agree to pay the difference, in my case this would be ¬£10 per charge.  So based on my 54 charges that would work out at ¬£540 - so at this point the ¬£860 offer looks a good one.</p>\n<p>Now of course the OFT ruling doesn't bind the courts.  I could still take Barclays to court and it would be up to them to demonstrate to the courts that it costs them more than ¬£4.50 per penalty charge.</p>\n<p>Martin's summary conclusion is that after the OFT ruling you are MORE likely to get some money back without a fight, but LESS likely to get all your money back without a fight.</p>\n<p>Taking all of that into account, and the fact that we're hoping to emigrate within weeks, and have much more pressing issues to deal with, my own conclusion is that I'm going to accept their offer.  I could probably get more back if I pushed it, but I've neither the time nor the inclination given our present circumstances.</p>\n<p>This doesn't mean I'm grateful to Barclays.  They had absolutely no right charging ¬£25 for an unauthorised overdraft fee when the law clearly states that punitive charges must be no more than the actual cost incurred by the bank.  What's more, even though hundreds of thousands of us are reclaiming our bank charges it's obviously having little affect on their bottom line given the amount of profit the banks have announced this year.</p>\n<p>Fight the bastards.  Consumer power - I love it!!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I had a night out last night with my mates for the first time since, well actually I think it's the first time this year (how sad is that!). <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\">Rach</span> also went out with her mates (the 'school mums') and we met up at the end of the night and came home together. It's funny that in 7 years we've never actually done that before - usually it's me staying in babysitting or <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\">vica</span>-<span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">versa</span> (less so - <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\">Rach</span> has got more mates than me). It made a refreshing change. For the first time in a long time I felt high on life last night. It must be because <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\">everything's</span> finally coming together.</p>\n<p>There's also another reason. It may sound silly but I've been reading a book in the last week which has had a profound effect on me. The book is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Yes-Man-Danny-Wallace/dp/0091896746/ref=sr_1_1/202-4456714-9166251?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1174129706&amp;sr=1-1\">Yes Man by Danny Wallace</a>. You know, Danny Wallace - the bloke who's currently presenting Castaway on BBC1 and did that series on BBC2 last year where he started his own country. Well in this one he basically decides to say yes to everything for a year, saying yes to every favour, request, suggestion and invitation. There's a bit of background to how it starts and why he does it, but the results are quite spectacular and should be a lesson to us all. It has certainly changed my outlook on life. I know it's only a book and some of the events may be exaggerated or made up for dramatic effect, but there's a clear message that begins to appear about halfway through the book - which is by being positive and open to new experiences, in general, good things will happen and you'll be a much happier and content person.</p>\n<p>If you think about it, I bet all the best things that have happened in your life came about because you said yes to something. Like for me, I met <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_5\">Rach</span> and we now have our beautiful daughter because one day 7 years ago I said yes to going out on her work leaving do even though I didn't really know her at the time. And now, we're about to start a whole new adventure because we're opening ourselves up to new experiences and opportunities. It's a bit extreme, I know, emigrating to the other side of the world, but if you don't say yes to things, your life will never change. It makes me laugh the number of people who have asked us why we're moving to Australia. My retort is: why should we not move to Australia?</p>\n<p>I'd encourage everyone to take a risk every now and again and try something new, perhaps even something life-changing like we're doing. After all, is this really the best life is going to get? Don't you want something more? Don't you want to experience new places and new cultures?</p>\n<p>I appreciate we're lucky and not everyone has the opportunities we do to make this move. No matter what your circumstances however, I strongly believe life will improve if you take a few risks and say YES. It's the same with money and business.  Most of the multi-millionaire entrepreneurs got where they are today because they took risks and gave it a go. I've recently read Duncan <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_6\">Bannatyne's</span> autobiography: Anyone Can Do It. He built his business group up on the back of spending a few quid on an ice cream van, and then took huge risks quickly expanding his business, nearly bankrupting himself in the process. Anyway, my main point is not about taking risks so much as about saying yes, but I guess the two can go hand in hand. Let's face it, we say no to things most of the time because we're either worried about the consequences, or we're worried about the unknown and the lack of control that saying yes might bring. Sometimes we also say no simply because we can't be bothered and it's too easy to say no. For instance, normally, I would have probably turned down the offer of a night out last night. My default position would be I've hard a hard week, my train doesn't get in to late and I just want to chill out in front of the TV. However, I decided to say yes and I ended up having a really good time. I don't think I've laughed so much in years.</p>\n<p>Say Yes to reading this book, it will change your outlook on life:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Yes-Man-Danny-Wallace/dp/0091896746/ref=sr_1_1/202-4456714-9166251?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174129706&amp;sr=1-1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://darylhaines.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/afe8d-yes.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5042860551435350610\" /></a><br />Oh by the way, yesterday I still didn't make the 16:18 from Manchester Piccadilly!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Every Friday I try and make the 16:18 from Manchester Piccadilly to go home for the weekend, and every week I fail and have to wait another hour for the 17:18.  I've come close on a couple of occasions - actually getting as far as watching the train move away just as I get to the platform.  But normally I'm about 2 or 3 minutes out.</p>\n<p>You see the client I'm working for now has got this stupid rule that I have to work my allotted hours never starting earlier than 8am or any later than 10am and never leaving any earlier than 4pm or any later than 6pm.  If only I could get out 3 minutes early I would be ok, but no, I'm destined to never make the 16:18!</p>\n<p>I've been trying to work out the schedule of the Manchester metro system which I use to get between my place of work and the station, but I've realised this is a futile exercise.  The trams are quite regular but they conspire against me to ensure I never quite reach my destination in time.  I've tried a few different options.  First I waited for the tram that takes my all the way, then I tried getting on the first available tram which doesn't go to my destination but will get me halfway, and after getting off I speed-walked, suitcase trailing behind me giving everyone in front of me the dead-eye to make sure they got out my way.  But no - still didn't make it.</p>\n<p>Last week I thought I had it.  Every week I've been buying tickets to use the metro before I get on, just as you're supposed to, but I started to notice that hardly anyone else was bothering.  I also realised that in all the time I've been in Manchester I've never actually been asked to produce a ticket.  So last week, I got to the tram stop and low and behold a tram turned up straight away.  So instead of risking trying to get a ticket on the platform before the tram pulls away again, I just jumped straight on without purchasing the ticket.  The tram wasn't going to my destination so I got off at the half-way point and low and behold again, another tram turned up on the adjacent platform just as I was getting off which would take me to the station.  So I jumped straight on board, confident that I would finally make the 16:18.  However, the next thing I heard was \"tickets please\".  Shit!  You see what I mean about destined never to make it in time.  Anyway, I jumped straight off again to avoid what I guessed would be a heavy fine.</p>\n<p>Now you could say that if I'd have bought a ticket last week in advance I would have made it, so maybe if the trams are in synch again this week and I've got a ticket, I will in fact finally make it.  No chance.  The stars will align, the wind will be blowing in the wrong direction, the cows will all be lying down, the birds will be flying backwards, and all the other universal factors will come into play to ensure that I never, ever, make the 16:18 from Piccadilly.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It seems funny that it's a year since my last post where I rejoiced the fact that we had finally received our visa, and yet it's only now that we're in a position where we're confident it's actually going to happen.</p>\n<p>The reason it's been a year is simply because that's how long it has taken us to sell our house. In fact, it's been longer than that because we originally put the house on the market when we first started the visa process, then took it off again because it wasn't selling, and then finally put it on again when we got the visa. What a nightmare! But finally it is sold (subject to contract):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/85/421459895_3abc813b79_o.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/85/421459895_3abc813b79_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:320px;\" /></a><br />The buyers aren't in a chain so it looks like we could be emigrating in weeks, rather than years which it was beginning to look like.  I suppose it hasn't really sunk in yet.  I guess I ought to start planning - we're not just moving house, we're moving life!</p>\n<p>Now things are actually happening and I don't feel in suspended animation anymore I guess I'll finally have something to write about.  Actually I'm kidding myself, quite a lot has happened in the last year.  For a start, we went back to Oz a second time at the end of last year.  Mainly out of necessity than the desire for a holiday.  When you receive your PR (permanent residency) visa you have a year to validate the visa or it expires.  What that basically means is that we each had to get a stamp on our visa in Australia, and because the visa didn't get granted until we we're in Singapore on our way out to Oz the first time, it was too late to get the visa included in our passports for when we entered Oz - bummer!  Of course, we completely expected to have sold the house within a short time after returning from our recce trip so didn't think the validation deadline would be a big issue.  How wrong were we!  It's not even as if they take the date as being a year from when the visa is granted - it's actually a year from when they received the medical and police checks prior to granting the visa, which for us was the beginning of Feb - 6 weeks before getting the visa.</p>\n<p>We could have done without the expense of having to take another trip to Oz within a year.  Don't get me wrong, we had a fantastic time again, but it was ¬£¬£¬£ that we could have used for settling into our new lives.  The whole reason why we couldn't emigrate before selling the house, i.e. not rent it out instead or leave it on sale while we start our new life in Oz, is because we need the equity in the house to pay off our debts and cover the risk of going to Oz without a job lined up prior to landing.</p>\n<p>Besides taking a second trip to Oz, I've also finally left my cushy permanent job and started IT contracting under my own limited company - something I've been wanting to do for ages but until now have never had the balls to do.  I'm now halfway through my first and what looks likely to be my last contract, at least in the UK anyway.  It's been a good experience, and there's definitely some upsides to contracting - some downsides too, which I roughly summarise as:</p>\n<p>Upsides\n<ul>\n<li>Financially lucrative: the rates are excellent and it will definitely give us that extra bit of money to cover us for a few months in Oz, just in case it takes me time to find a new job</li>\n<li>New learning experience: I'm consulting for a large company so I'm learning a lot about how large companies work and I'll be able to to take that with me for future jobs</li>\n<li>Different work relationship: because I'm not a permanent employee of the company there's no expectation to stay late or do overtime as there is with permanent positions, they're basically paying me for a given number of hours and if they want any extra I have to agree to it, at my rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Downsides<br />The major downside is I couldn't find a contract near where I live so I'm having to work away during the week in Manchester.  I suppose you could look at the positives of this because I'm beginning to realise that Manchester is a cool city, however, I did my stint of working away from home when I was in the Navy for 7 1/2 years - I'm a home bird now.  Plus, I've now got a 5 year old daughter as well who I'm only getting to see at the weekends, as well as <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\">Rach</span> of course.  I'm actually writing this now from the loneliness of my hotel room, sob sob.</p>\n<p>There's been other stuff of course which has happened in the last year but really it's the future that matters - so I guess I ought to start writing my Emigration Action Plan!</p>\n",

Problem with my job is I can't really just pass work on while I'm away, it will all be waiting for me when I return. </p>\n<p>I got a phone call right out of the blue yesterday from a recruitment agency we use at work to recruit people for my team.  It started like this: \"Daryl, can we talk confidentially?\".  Immediately I thought it would be about my boss who's recently resigned but in fact, he told me a job had come up with another company which he thought I was perfect for.   Now if it wasn't for the fact that I am actually pissed off with where I work now I would have thought this was a bit of a conflict of interest.  My company pays them to find excellent candidates to work for us, not poach our employees away.  I guess that's business.</p>\n<p>Anyway the position he wants to put me forward for is for a well-know global IT company and the salary is double what I'm on now.   I told him I'm planning to emigrate early next year but he said so what, earn some extra dosh before you leave.  One side of me is thinking yes, get in there, earn as much dosh as possible before leaving.  The other side is saying you really don't need the stress.  My current job is flexible, I get to work from home a lot and I manage my own workload.  I could easily see out the rest of the year where I work and have plenty of time to deal with selling the house and all the other things I need to do to prepare to emigrate.  The other thing is I'm jointly running a business on the side which I've committed to.  We have big plans for the business (at least until I emigrate anyway) but there's no saying it will actually make any money.  Do I really want to start a new highly paid job, which will obviously mean long hours and lots of stress to earn the money, whilst running a separate business and preparing to emigrate?  I'm going to send them my CV.  Nothing may come of it but I've learnt that you always need to leave your options open.</p>\n",

I've booked day flights which I thought would be best but now it's dawned on me that the flight to Singapore gets in at 7am and we can't check in to the hotel until 2pm (after a 17 hour flight!).  I've sent an e-mail to the hotel to see if there's any chance we can get an early check-in.  I really don't want to have to pay for another night just for those few hours in the morning.

I don't think getting rat-arsed is a good idea on a 17 hour flight, I'm far too sensible these days!  I suppose we could always sleep by the pool when we get there.  I'm more worried about the return leg when we get into Singapore even earlier at 5:45.  I haven't booked a hotel for the return leg yet as I thought I'd see what it's like on our stopover on the way out first.</p>\n<p>Listen to me, it's usually the missus who does all the worrying, I'm the laid back one supposedly!</p>\n",

The 'we' is me Daryl, my partner Rachelle (pronounced Rachel (blame her mum) ) and our 4 year old daughter Lauren.</p>\n<p>I can't really remember when it was exactly that we decided we want to emigrate to Australia.  We were thinking about it for a while and it was after we visited an OZ migration Expo in London in Nov/Dec 2004 I think that we committed to going for it.</p>\n<p>We started the application process in January 2005 and now finally, in March 2006, we've done everything we can to secure the Visa and are now just waiting on a decision.  Anyone who thinks it's easy to get into Australia - think again!  It's been a long drawn out, expensive process.</p>\n<p>While we're awaiting the decision we will be shortly taking a 3-week holiday/recce to Oz.  Having never visited Oz before we thought it would be wise to actually see if we liked it first before we emigrated.  I know it sounds obvious but you wouldn't believe the amount of people that emigrate without ever having visited the place.</p>\n<p>It's now 10 days to go until we jet off on what will hopefully be a holiday of a lifetime!</p>\n",
