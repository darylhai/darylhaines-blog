However, it didn’t need to be 3 hrs long. The film peaked at the Trinity Test, and then went into a courtroom drama for the last hour. This was interesting but in no way met the dramatic tension of the Manhattan Project. </p><p>I like the fact that it didn’t dumb down and there’s a lot of assumed knowledge about this era for the viewers. </p><p>The score wasn’t as overfacing as other Christopher Nolan films and as always there’s plenty of beautiful cinematography to chew over.</p><p>Not an immediate rewatchable but I can understand why it won the Best Picture Oscar nonetheless.</p>\n",

Pretty quickly the grafting process would start and my body would be building a new immune system - using someone else&rsquo;s stem cells. My blood DNA would change.

My goal was for it to be 4 weeks and not a day longer. Of course, much of this is out of your hands. However, there are things you can do to reduce the chances of it being longer.

I’ve had mucusitus with every chemo cycle and the same happened this time. I think I may have delayed it a few days but sure enough, about a week and a half after finishing chemo it quickly set in with a vengeance. I couldn’t swallow anything. They had to switch my tablets to IV meds and I was on a fluid diet for a week.

I have no idea what happened but I didn’t get discharged until 1am. It was crazy. My wife was getting increasingly agitated. The nurses on the ward were constantly apologetic but it was completely out of their control. I have no idea what the problem was but it seems to me that pharmacy is completely dysfunctional.

It is nice to sleep in my own bed and not get woken in the night multiple times for obs.</p>\n<p>As I explained in my previous post, now is the time for home isolation. I have no immune system so it’s a case of being really, really careful to avoid picking up anything that will lead to me being hospitalised again.

Nearly everyone who goes through this does - multiple times.</p>\n<p>I’m taking no chances though. If I have any visitors they get temperature checked at the door and need to wear a mask.

				"title": "Transplant Day and the Road Ahead",
				"content_html": "<p>Here we go. Tomorrow is the big day. This week has been about undergoing conditioning chemo to prepare my body for the transplant.</p>\n<p>Most people hear the word transplant and think it involves surgery. In the case of blood cancers it&rsquo;s simply a blood transfusion. I say &lsquo;simply&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s not like the many blood transfusions I&rsquo;ve had since being diagnosed, this one has profound implications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conditioning-chemo\">Conditioning Chemo</h2>\n<p>This week I&rsquo;ve been isolated in a hospital room undergoing chemotherapy that has the sole goal of killing my bone marrow. The bone marrow produces the stem cells which produces the blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets). In the case of Leukaemia it&rsquo;s the white blood cells that are the problem.</p>\n<p>It has been very similar to all the chemo I&rsquo;ve been through previously. If all goes to plan, this could be my final day and I&rsquo;ll never need it again.</p>\n<p>It was going pretty well until yesterday. I had an allergic reaction to the day 6 chemo. It&rsquo;s fairly common and they gave me pre-meds to try and prevent the reaction. I got close to the end of the 4-hour infusion and within seconds the reaction started (I think the pre-meds had worn off) - rash and swelling in my face, sickness and diarrhoea, fever. It&rsquo;s happened before and I wasn&rsquo;t too worried. It took them sometime to get it under control but I&rsquo;m now ok for the final chemo today.</p>\n<p>I also had an x-ray in my left foot. About 3 weeks ago I noticed my left foot had swollen up and become incredibly tender. This week the consultant looked at it and thought it may be gout brought on by all the meds. He got a rheumatologist to look at it, who concurred, but booked me in for an x-ray anyway just to check for other things. Bizarrely, the x-ray revealed a lump of metal in my big toe. How long it’s been there or how it even got there without me noticing is a mystery. It could be entirely unrelated and the swelling could still be gout. Either way, it’s too dangerous to cut my toe open now. The metal will have to stay there for the time being. I’m on meds for gout anyway as part of the conditioning treatment. The steroids will hopefully deal with the swelling.</p>\n<p>Today requires close planning and timing. I have to reach a certain hydration level before they give me the IV chemo and there has to be 24 hours between chemo and the transplant.</p>\n<p>My hair had started to grow back during the maintenance chemo that I&rsquo;ve had in the last 6 weeks. I&rsquo;ve been told to expect to lose it all again - probably around the middle of next week.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transplant-day\">Transplant Day</h2>\n<p>Transplant day, also known as zero day or re-birth day is when the fun begins. I know what to expect with chemo and how to deal with it. The transplant, however, is a big mystery. No one can say for certain how my body will react.</p>\n<p>Sometime this week the donor has had the procedure to donate his bone marrow. I&rsquo;m not allowed to know who the donor is, and my hospital aren&rsquo;t allowed to know either. Once delivered, they have 72 hours to get it into me. Unfortunately, the survival chance is a bit lower for an unrelated matched donor than a sibling. Them&rsquo;s the breaks.</p>\n<p>The fact that a healthy donor is volunteering to have a bone marrow biopsy for a complete stranger is amazing to me. It&rsquo;s one thing giving blood or signing consent to give up your organs when you die, this is another thing entirely. The donor could save my life. I hope one day I can properly offer my thanks.</p>\n<p>Unlike a normal blood transfusion which is managed by the nurses, this one is all managed by the transplant team. The team will come into my room, set up the infusion into my central line (Hickman line) and slowly deliver the stem cells over a period of about 2 hours. My family will be here in the room. The isolation room is due to the lack of an immune system. All staff and visitors have to enter an ante-room, get into a gown, gloves and face mask before entering my room. Anyone who has visited Covid patients in hospital will be very familiar with this.</p>\n<p>Once delivered, the scary stuff could start pretty quickly - within minutes. The main risk is graft versus host disease (GvHD). The transplanted cells can start to attack the other cells in my body. I&rsquo;ve been told the body could reactivate anything I&rsquo;ve had in the past - chicken pox, mumps, etc. Vaccination history is no longer a factor. It could also go after my organs, which is a little more scary.</p>\n<p>I can expect to stay another 3-5 weeks in hospital in isolation and under close observation. After this time, they should have a good idea whether the transplant has been a success.</p>\n<p>One of the things that I find amazing and never really thought about is that my DNA is going to change. DNA is in the blood. I&rsquo;ll have a mix of my own DNA and the donor&rsquo;s DNA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2>\n<p>From today, they will give me drugs to continue to suppress my immune system for a few months. This is a very dangerous time. I have to be really careful about who and what I come into contact with as a simple cold can spell disaster.</p>\n<p>I also have to be on a neutropenic diet.

				"content_text": "Here we go. Tomorrow is the big day. This week has been about undergoing conditioning chemo to prepare my body for the transplant.\n\nMost people hear the word transplant and think it involves surgery. In the case of blood cancers it's simply a blood transfusion. I say 'simply', it's not like the many blood transfusions I've had since being diagnosed, this one has profound implications.\n\n## Conditioning Chemo\nThis week I've been isolated in a hospital room undergoing chemotherapy that has the sole goal of killing my bone marrow. The bone marrow produces the stem cells which produces the blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets). In the case of Leukaemia it's the white blood cells that are the problem.\n\nIt has been very similar to all the chemo I've been through previously. If all goes to plan, this could be my final day and I'll never need it again. \n\nIt was going pretty well until yesterday. I had an allergic reaction to the day 6 chemo. It's fairly common and they gave me pre-meds to try and prevent the reaction. I got close to the end of the 4-hour infusion and within seconds the reaction started (I think the pre-meds had worn off) - rash and swelling in my face, sickness and diarrhoea, fever. It's happened before and I wasn't too worried. It took them sometime to get it under control but I'm now ok for the final chemo today. \n\nI also had an x-ray in my left foot. About 3 weeks ago I noticed my left foot had swollen up and become incredibly tender. This week the consultant looked at it and thought it may be gout brought on by all the meds. He got a rheumatologist to look at it, who concurred, but booked me in for an x-ray anyway just to check for other things. Bizarrely, the x-ray revealed a lump of metal in my big toe. How long it’s been there or how it even got there without me noticing is a mystery. It could be entirely unrelated and the swelling could still be gout. Either way, it’s too dangerous to cut my toe open now. The metal will have to stay there for the time being. I’m on meds for gout anyway as part of the conditioning treatment. The steroids will hopefully deal with the swelling.\n\nToday requires close planning and timing. I have to reach a certain hydration level before they give me the IV chemo and there has to be 24 hours between chemo and the transplant.\n\nMy hair had started to grow back during the maintenance chemo that I've had in the last 6 weeks. I've been told to expect to lose it all again - probably around the middle of next week.\n\n## Transplant Day\nTransplant day, also known as zero day or re-birth day is when the fun begins. I know what to expect with chemo and how to deal with it. The transplant, however, is a big mystery. No one can say for certain how my body will react.\n\nSometime this week the donor has had the procedure to donate his bone marrow. I'm not allowed to know who the donor is, and my hospital aren't allowed to know either. Once delivered, they have 72 hours to get it into me. Unfortunately, the survival chance is a bit lower for an unrelated matched donor than a sibling. Them's the breaks.\n\nThe fact that a healthy donor is volunteering to have a bone marrow biopsy for a complete stranger is amazing to me. It's one thing giving blood or signing consent to give up your organs when you die, this is another thing entirely. The donor could save my life. I hope one day I can properly offer my thanks.\n\nUnlike a normal blood transfusion which is managed by the nurses, this one is all managed by the transplant team. The team will come into my room, set up the infusion into my central line (Hickman line) and slowly deliver the stem cells over a period of about 2 hours. My family will be here in the room. The isolation room is due to the lack of an immune system. All staff and visitors have to enter an ante-room, get into a gown, gloves and face mask before entering my room. Anyone who has visited Covid patients in hospital will be very familiar with this.\n\nOnce delivered, the scary stuff could start pretty quickly - within minutes. The main risk is graft versus host disease (GvHD). The transplanted cells can start to attack the other cells in my body. I've been told the body could reactivate anything I've had in the past - chicken pox, mumps, etc. Vaccination history is no longer a factor. It could also go after my organs, which is a little more scary.\n\nI can expect to stay another 3-5 weeks in hospital in isolation and under close observation. After this time, they should have a good idea whether the transplant has been a success.\n\nOne of the things that I find amazing and never really thought about is that my DNA is going to change. DNA is in the blood. I'll have a mix of my own DNA and the donor's DNA.\n\n## The Road Ahead\nFrom today, they will give me drugs to continue to suppress my immune system for a few months. This is a very dangerous time. I have to be really careful about who and what I come into contact with as a simple cold can spell disaster. \n\nI also have to be on a neutropenic diet. Pregnant women are familiar with the basic stuff - no soft cheeses, no shell fish, etc. This goes a bit further. I must have boiled water, no salads or shop-bought sandwiches, only fruit with a peel, no takeaways or any kind of food that could have been sat around for a while (like Greggs), etc, etc. There's a large list of what I can and can't have. It's going to be a pain in this ass for Rach. She's an angel but I do worry about the toll it's going to take on her as my carer. \n\nI'll need to return to hospital twice a week during the first year for blood tests. It could also be another year before I can work again. Best case scenario is that I may be able to pick up a computer and do a bit of online work after 3 months but it's doubtful I could get insurance for a contract or get a full-time job during this time.\n\nAfter a year I have to have all my childhood vaccinations and COVID jabs again. I'll have a new immune system. I could have completely new allergies.\n\nFor the rest of my life I need to carry a transplant card with me indicating that I have irradiated blood, just in case something happens and I need a blood transfusion.\n\nIf all goes well this is the beginning of the end. Cancer takes over your life. I want to think, talk and write about something else. I even miss work.\n\nThe adventure begins tomorrow!\n",

Since then, it has continued to be a roller coaster. I ended up having 6 cycles of chemo and spent 5 months in hospital (so far). We made the flights that we originally booked and I&rsquo;m now under the care of the transplant team at Sheffield Hallamshire hospital.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chemo-and-infections\">Chemo and Infections</h2>\n<p>Chemotherapy has been tough. Many of the side effects repeated with each cycle but I did get better at managing them. The protocol for my treatment required two different courses of treatment - A and B. This was repeated 3 times - hence the 6 cycles. A and B had different drugs and I&rsquo;m still trying to make my mind up which was worse. I had a few bad reactions to some of them so they were tweaked as we went along. Each cycle followed a familiar pattern over 3 weeks - a few days of IV and oral chemo until I was neutropenic (no immune system), a few days of recovery, and then more days of chemo.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks, being in hospital was driving me nuts. I could look out of the window and see our apartment across the road. The doctor could tell it was having an impact on my mental health so had to weigh up the risk of letting me out for a break against the risk of me staying in and turning into a mental wreck. The first two cycles of chemo were back to back. After that, they were happy for me to go home for a 1 week break between cycles. It was never enough. I would be at home in recovery but still having all the side effects - fatigue, nausea and vomiting, etc. I would get to day 6 of being at home and just starting to feel a little better when it was time to go back in again.</p>\n<p>After the first couple of cycles they also gave me a pass to go home mid-cycle for the recovery days with a warning that if I started to get feverish I would need to come back in straight away because even a cold could kill me. They had seen it all before and they were absolutely right. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I would go across the road to my apartment, not leave it, and nearly every time I would pick up an infection. After a few months this was devastating. I&rsquo;d be desperate to get out of hospital (just to get some sleep, if nothing else), and sometimes within hours I would feel myself getting a fever. Rach would take my temperature and as soon as it got close to 38 degrees I&rsquo;d be back in hospital again. I stupidly argued with her - trying to come up with any rationale why it&rsquo;s not really a fever and we should wait a little longer. She rightly was having none of it. So I&rsquo;d go back in and immediately get put on a course of antibiotics. This often then delayed my discharge at the end of the cycle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"weight-losshair-loss-etc\">Weight loss,Hair Loss, .etc</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m no longer overweight. I&rsquo;m back in 32 inch trousers for the first time in many years and even they were falling off me when I got discharged after the 6th cycle. I know some people on chemo put on weight (mainly due to the steroids), but in my case I was only on steroids for a few days at the beginning of each cycle. The weight loss has been due to a combination of loss of appetite, nausea and mucusitus (which happened every cycle).</p>\n<p>After the 6 cycles of chemo I got put onto maintenance chemo for the trip back to the UK and while waiting for the bone marrow transplant. This is essentially one tablet a day of oral chemo (Dasatanib) alongside the other meds I need to protect my organs and deal with the side effects. The reduced dose has meant my hair has started to grow back, my appetite has returned and even my tastebuds are coming back. It will no doubt all go again with the high dose chemo required in preparation for the transplant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheelchair\">Wheelchair</h2>\n<p>For the first couple of cycles I was highly motivated to work with the physio and keep up exercise to try and stop muscle loss. However, as the chemo went on and on, the side effects persisted and the fatigue kicked my butt. I just got weaker and weaker. I only really noticed how weak I was becoming when I got to go home. Just walking across the road and going up a few steps became a struggle.</p>\n<p>I was dead set against using a wheelchair but Rach convinced me to use one for Lauren&rsquo;s graduation. I&rsquo;m glad I listened to her. I realised how bad things had become when I got out of the wheelchair to get into the shuttle bus to go over to the other side of the campus.

I've been plagued with them over the years and thought they were back. For 2 weeks I'd been suffering back and shoulder pains. At first I thought it was just posture pain from spending too much time at my computer. I was between contracts and using the time to make as much progress as possible on the app I've been developing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was a Friday and Rach convinced me to go to Costco with her and Lauren. I'd never been and she promised it would be an experience (lol), and I really needed to get out the apartment. I made it about halfway round before I thought I was going to pass out. It was still the next day before I went to the hospital. Blokes are generally terrible for seeking medical help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next day Rach and Lauren were out at Woolworths and I was in agony so I finally succumbed and walked over to the hospital. Luckily, we live directly opposite an hospital - which has turned out to be very handy indeed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I got triaged by the nurse before being sent for a CT scan and bloods. The CT scan revealed that I had mild pancreatitis, which was a surprise. The bigger surprise was to come from the blood tests.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A while later I was visited by Dr Shanavas, a haematologist. He would go on to become my main treating doctor. He told me that my white blood count was raised, I think 3 times above normal levels. Rach caught on straight away. I was a bit slower to catch on. I may know a lot about cybersecurity but my medical knowledge is severely lacking - at least it was at that point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>More tests were needed. The next day he returned to say that count had doubled overnight. Tests were pointing to acute Leukaemia. I would need a bone marrow biopsy tomorrow to confirm the exact type.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He explained the next steps. I would start on chemotherapy straight away. If it's the Leukaemia type he expected I would likely need at least four cycles of chemotherapy before being put forward for a bone marrow transplant. The first point of call for the transplant is my brother. There would be a 30% chance that he's a match. If no match then they go to the general donor register. That has a 70% chance of a match. Last resort would be my daughter Lauren. I really hope it doesn't come to that. He explained that it's a long process and even if all goes well I'd be looking at being out of work for a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Things started to finally sink in. I got upset, but strangely the stuff that was racing through my head was not concerns over my health, but worries about the financial situation and a feeling of utter stupidity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had given up my permanent job at Telstra in December to go contracting under my own business. Contracting can be lucrative but there's no sick pay, holidays, etc. If you don't work, you don't earn. I had finished one 6 month contract but had already been out of work for about 6 weeks when I got the diagnosis. We have savings but we also have expenses - most notably an expensive riverside apartment. A rent of $900 a week was fine when I was earning good money. Now we would be reliant upon Rach's income, and she was part-time. Not only that, when I left Telstra I moved my superannuation to the new Vanguard fund. I'd been put on the base level of income protection and life insurance and not yet got around to increasing it. I felt like an idiot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Those first few days were a rollercoaster. The next day I had the bone marrow biopsy and started chemo. The bone marrow test confirmed I have Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia with Philadelphia positive (ALL-B+). Besides knowing that Leukaemia is a blood cancer I was utterly clueless at this time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The white cell count had doubled again. Dr. Shanavas explained that if I hadn't come into hospital when I did I would have been dead within 3 weeks. That concentrated the mind. Never again will I just put up with the pain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Private Medical Insurance</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In Australia, a single person earning over $93,000 or a family with income over $186,000 gets hit with an extra tax - the Medicare Surcharge Levy. This can be avoided if you have private hospital cover from an approved insurance provider. The idea is to encourage those who can afford it get to get private cover to take the strain off the public system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Until now, I've had private hospital cover for years and never made use of it to check in to a private hospital. I also never bothered getting the additional Extras cover for dental, physio, etc as i ran the numbers and it never made financial sense.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Coming from the UK with the NHS, for a long time I was reticent about the Australian system. The two-tier system just felt wrong. Yet another thing where money talks. I was of the opinion that quality healthcare and education should be available to everyone, irrespective of ability to pay.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My view has now become a bit more pragmatic. Especially when looking at wait times on the NHS. As egalitarian as the UK system is, I really believe that it's unsustainable in the long term.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Up until now (mainly for my kidney stones treatment), I had checked into a public hospital and let the public hospital claim on my private cover. A bit worthy I know but I never gave it much thought.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This time I'm in a private hospital and extremely grateful that I am.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first got admitted I was put in a shared room with one other. A bit later I was moved to another shared room. In both cases I was sharing with old deaf men who insisted on having their TV on at the loudest setting 24hrs a day. Luckily I eventually got moved to a private room to start my chemo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chemotherapy</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I could probably do a longer post just on chemo. Talk about a rollercoaster. Every day is different and you just don't know what to expect (at least during the initial cycles). The thing about chemo is that it does a great job of killing the cancer cells, but it also kills a lot of cells that you need, particularly in the gut lining, the mouth and hair follicles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The chemo protocol is different each day and has involved a bunch of drugs I had never heard of - Cytarabina, Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Cyclophosphomide, etc. All of which have their own side-effects. Most of these are administered via IV. Some are oral tablets. Twice each cycle I also have to go for a lumber puncture to deliver one of the chemo drugs to protect the brain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As well as the chemo I've been administered heavy doses of the steroid dexamethasone. If anything, the side-effect of this were just had bad as some of the chemo drugs, particularly in the first cycle. I was told that It would make me hypersensitive and would affect sleep. Yes and more. It sent me a bit loopy. The worst day was when I had short-term memory loss. The confusion was one of the scariest things I've ever experienced. I now have a bit of knowledge about what it must be like for dementia sufferers. I really hope I never get dementia.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The physical pain can be handled. When I need it, I get Panadol, Endone, and one time I even had Fentanyl. I was a bit reluctant to have this after visiting San Francisco and Vancouver and seeing first-hand the utter destruction Fentanyl addiction is causing. The staff assured me that in hospital it's strictly controlled and I don't have to worry about addiction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The mental effects though are something that you just have to take. There is no drug you can take. You just have to hope it's temporary and will pass. Luckily it did and so far I haven't experienced anything like what I went through in cycle 1.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the worst side-effects from chemo has been Mucositis. Each cycle this has manifested after a few days. It starts with a sore throat and before long it's extremely painful to swallow. Given the amount of drugs I have to to take orally each day to counter the chemo, this in itself is an ordeal. The soft food diet has resulted in me losing 14kg of weight so far. I'm sure its not all down to the Mucositis. Some of this is muscle loss from spending 8 weeks in hospital. I'm following a physio plan but there's many days when the chemo means it's a struggle just to get out of bed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Code Blue</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had a full body P.E.T scan to discover if there were any other cancers lurking. The scan found a lesion on my colon. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had a colonoscopy, which luckily found that it was just a polyp. They removed the polyp but I ended up with some significant bleeding. The next day I had a further colonoscopy where they proudly proclaimed they had fixed the bleeding. They hadn't.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That evening, after sitting on the toilet for perhaps the seventh time, I suddenly new I was about to faint. I managed to hit the call button before I passed out. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I awoke to mayhem. I was flat out on the floor of the bathroom. There were perhaps 8 people in my room all looking worried. Alarms going off everywhere. I found out later that I was found unresponsive and they called a code blue. They even gave me chest compressions. My initial reaction was bemusement. I kept telling them that I felt fine but they were taking it extremely serious. To the point where all the staff on the ward kept mentioning the scare for days later.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Luckily the bleeding cleared up after a couple of days.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sleep, or Lack Thereof</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tiredness and sleep is a perennial problem. You would think that spending all this time in hospital with nothing to do would mean I would have plenty of time to watch movies and read books. Not so. On chemo days the mental clarity is really a problem. I could only look at a screen for about 30 mins before I lose focus. It was certainly like that in the first few weeks. It's getting better now - to the point where I'm able to spend a few hours each day working on my app. More on the app another time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sleep is a real problem. I'm hooked up to the IV stack via a PICC line in my arm for most hours during the day. The PICC line is a thin wire inserted into a vein in my arm that comes out to 3 separate lumens. This allows multiple drugs to be administered at once while also being able to retrieve blood. I have to have daily blood tests - for some reason they insist on doing this at 4am. When I had the PICC inserted they said some patients have it in for 8 months. I'm on my 3rd PICC already. After a couple of weeks the nurses have problems extracting blood. I don't know whether this is a particular problem with my compatibility or they're just not flushing the lumens properly. What this means is that once they fail to take blood they call for the vampires in Pathology to take peripherals (i.e stick me in the other arm). After a while the other arm becomes like a pin cushion and extremely soar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The IV alarms are constantly going off - end of infusion, upstream collusion, downstream collusion, air bubble (that one's a bit scary). I swear to god I'll be hearing those alarms in my sleep for years to come. Then there's the general hospital noise 24/7. Even though I'm in a private room the walls are very thin. I can hear the same alarms going off throughout the ward and often the nurses choose my room to stand outside at 3am and have chat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the end of each cycle I have a bone marrow biopsy to test the results of the chemo. This one's a bit of an ordeal the day of two after. It results in joint stiffening and pain all over.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Luckily, after the first cycle I received the fantastic news that I was in remission. Not only that - deep remission. This meant that I have something like a less than 0.001 chance of recurrence. That doesn't mean the chemo stops. I still need to do at least four cycles and have the transplant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the end of first cycle they let me out for a weekend pass. At the end of the second cycle they let me out for a full 6 days. Bliss. To sleep in my own bed and not get interrupted, and eat something different to hospital food.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bugs</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have picked up two blood infections since being in hospital. One has been treated. The other is a Carbapenem-resistant&nbsp;<em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>&nbsp;(CRE) superbug. This can't be treated with antibiotics and I just have to live with it. It's not really a problem for me. The problem is for other patient. What this means is that I'm on permanent contact precautions while in hospital. I have to have my own room and any staff entering the room have to rig up with gloves and protective clothing so they don't pass it on to other patients. It's a pain in the arse for them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plans</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before getting the diagnosis we had already planned to return to the UK. Lauren graduates from University in December and is planning on backpacking around Europe for a while. We've now lived in Australia for 16 years and are ready for a change. The COVID lockdown experience made us realise how isolated were are out here. Also, priorities shift the older you get. We came here for the lifestyle, but the longer we've been away the more we have missed friends and family, and everything that the UK and the proximity to Europe offers. We're also completely over the Brisbane heat and humidity. The plan was to go and live in London for a year. We love London and luckily with my career it shouldn't be that difficult to pick up work. Obviously that's out of the window now. Rental costs and not being able to work makes it a non-starter. There's also the question of family support. Rach will not be able to work for 3 months after transplant to be my carer. Any extra family support (for Rach) will be particularly welcome.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Flights were booked before I got diagnosed. We haven't cancelled them. My chemo should finish around about mid-October. It now all depends on the transplant. Our Dr has sent an email to the transplant team at Sheffield Royal Hallamshire to make contact. If all goes well we're hoping to get a transfer to Sheffield for the transplant. Timing is an issue though. Apparently they don't like a gap of more than one month between chemo and transplant. This probably means that I either have to continue further chemo here right up until December, or I fly back early and miss Lauren's graduation. Both scenarios are not ideal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We will then need to look for a place to rent. We're thinking at the moment it will probably be somewhere back near family in Worksop, not too far from Sheffield. Rent is less than half what it would be in London. Luckily we have enough savings to cover the year out of work. It's a shame we have to use it but I guess that's what savings are for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Feeling Grateful</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm grateful for my care team. Besides the nurses, who really are angels (I couldn't do that job), I have Dr. Shanavas who is a bona-fide expert and seems to be able to accurately predict to the day what side effects I will get, and importantly, when they will end. I also have other experts that regularly visit me to check on my liver, diet, physio and other aspects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most importantly, I'm grateful for Rachelle and Lauren. Rach managed to pick up extra hours at work while still allowing a late start and early finish to visit me in hospital. Even though we only live across the road Rach insists on being here all the time. I keep telling her to go home but she wants to be here with me. I know it's taking its toll. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, I'm tired now and returning to my sick bed. More later. Hopefully it's not another 4 years again before I post another blog post!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ce8dbf5987.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After moving in the to city from the suburbs I’ve seriously embraced city living, to the point where I’ve even been using the <a href=\"https://www.li.me\">Lime Scooters</a>. Brisbane is conducting a trial of electric scooters and there are 500 of them randomly scattered in and around the CBD. A 43 year old man on an electric scooter. It’s a good look. Honest.</p>\n<p>The scooters are a fabulous idea but I worry that the scooter wankers out there are going to ruin it for the rest of us. As is usually the case.</p>\n<p>The problem appears to be two-fold. The first issue is that Queensland law means that you must wear a helmet, but people keep nicking the helmets. Finding a scooter with an attached helmet is completely pot-luck. The other problem is that scooter wankers <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-30/electric-scooters-riders-fined-safety-breaches-brisbane-qld/10956110\">are getting pissed up and riding them on their way back from a night out</a>, scaring the shit out of pedestrians with their antics.</p>\n<p>Queensland Police have announced that they are <a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/police-launch-taskforce-to-target-stupid-e-scooter-riders-20190330-p5196y.html\">setting up a task force to catch the scooter wankers</a>, which is fair enough. </p>\n<p>Where to begin with this? </p>\n<p>I made the mistake of looking at the comments on social media in response to the articles. The consensus seems to be mass hysteria about the inevitable deaths that will occur.</p>\n<p>This is the problem. We can’t have nice things. A few wankers piss people off, causing people to make a mountain out of a molehill. They moan like hell on social media, so of course, local news picks up on it and hype it up even further.</p>\n<p>Both problems are genuine concerns, but it doesn’t mean that they should be banned. Why is the immediate answer to ban everything?</p>\n<p>With regards to helmets, one of two things need to happen. Either the Queensland Parliament need to relax the laws on helmets - perhaps accepting that an adult riding a scooter 6 inches off the ground is not the same as a child on a bicycle, or, the scooter operators need to come up with a technical solution to stop the helmets going walkabout. This will inevitably cost money and might make the whole enterprise non-viable. I have no idea, but let’s at least explore the options.</p>\n<p>As for the scooter wankers, let’s see what happens. The whole experience is relatively new for the streets of Brisbane, so there will be many unfamiliar with the legislation, and many others who just see it as a novelty that might not last. Hopefully the safety campaign has an effect.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>My thoughts on today’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2019/\">Apple Special Event</a> covering the new services...</p>\n<h2 id=\"apple-tv-and-apple-tv-\">Apple TV and Apple TV+</h2>\n<p>All the press before the event speculated on Apple launching a Netflix-killing TV service. Well, let’s wait and see. Judging by the fact that they didn’t even play a single trailer for a show, they’re clearly a long way from being ready. When they do launch later this year there will be perhaps 20-30 original productions. A good start, but they’ve got a lot of catching up to do to begin challenging Netflix, and there was no mention of which other studios will be including content within the + service.</p>\n<p>They did say that we will be able to purchase separate subscriptions to HBO, Showtime, etc. Oh joy, yet more subscriptions. TV is becoming that fragmented it’s getting to the point that it makes sense to go back to Cable/Satellite TV again.</p>\n<p>The TV app on iOS and Apple TV leaves a lot to be desired. There wasn’t much mention of new features or interface changes, but then that’s a software thing, not services. Hopefully we’ll hear about some significant improvements at WWDC in June.</p>\n<p>The main problems I currently have with the TV app are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of support for multiple profiles</li>\n<li>No separate Watch List, just the ability to add shows to Up Next, and no abillity to change the order of shows in Up Next.</li>\n<li>A lack of integration with Netflix and Stan. Netflix integration will likely never happen from what I’ve read.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that the TV app is now coming to Smart TVs and even Roku, I hope that doesn’t signal the end of the Apple TV. For those of us who still play content from a large iTunes library running from a home media server, Apple TV for me is still the best way to watch that content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apple-arcade\">Apple Arcade</h2>\n<p>I’m not sure I will subscribe to Apple Arcade. I&#039;m not much of a gamer. It does look an interesting proposition though. I wonder in the long run how the exclusivity agreement will play out with developers? Will the revenue they get from Apple Arcade make up for the potential loss of revenue from not being able to launch on Android?</p>\n<h2 id=\"apple-news-\">Apple News +</h2>\n<p>It will be interesting to see which publishers are on board when the Apple News  + subscription reaches Australia later in the year.</p>\n<p>In the US, 200 magazines is not particularly a lot, and Apple must be severely disappointed to only have two newspapers sign up on launch. </p>\n<p>As with the TV app, I hope we’ll see some improvements to the News app beyond just support for the magazine design they showed in the keynote. At the moment I still prefer <a href=\"https://flipboard.com\">Flipboard</a> to consume news. It’s a simple thing but I love the animation of flipping between articles. I also like the fact you can add any RSS to Flipboard - Apple requires publishers to optimise content fo the Apple News app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apple-card\">Apple Card</h2>\n<p>I hope the Apple Card comes to Australia. It&#039;s very hard to find a credit card in Australia that has no fees (including no international transaction fees), is a reward card, and supports Apple Pay. </p>\n<p>Apple marketed the Apple Card has having a low interest rate. When you look into it that low interest rate in the US is between 13% and 24% dependent upon credit worthiness. Low interest rate my arse. Of course, it’s not an issue if you pay off your balance every month.</p>\n<p>With no fees, 2% cash back (3% on purchases of Apple stuff), and the ability to use it pretty much everywhere in Australia (where there’s a 99% contactless adoption rate), I could see it becoming my main card, if, and it’s a big if, we get the same deal in Australia. </p>\n<p>It’s a shame they’ve partnered with Goldman Sachs. After the 2008 GFC, Goldman Sachs should be liquidated and their Directors in jail.</p>\n",

It’s essentially the podcast version of the BBC Radio Five Live Afternoon Edition show. When I started listening it was hosted by Simon Mayo. Then Richard Bacon took over for a few years. He eventually left for some gig in the US and then Dan Walker and Sarah Brett hosted for a short while. Now it’s hosted by Nihal Arthanayake. This is one of those where I just listen to the episodes depending on who’s being interviewed. </p>\n<p>I’m not too keen on the latest host to be honest. A little too sycophantic to his guest for my liking. A little too keen to be pals with the guests and make them laugh. Although, to give him credit, his interviewing has improved over the last year. He’s no Simon Mayo though. Too many interviewers try and make the interview about them. Simon Mayo positively shies away from that.</p>\n<p>Another interview-based podcast that is worth a listen - <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/381444908/fresh-air\">Fresh Air (NPR)</a>.\n<br style=\"clear:both;\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrvln/episodes/downloads\" title=\"Headliners Podcast\">Listen to the Headliners Podcast</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"desert-island-discs-bbc-\">Desert Island Discs (BBC)</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/62cee8ff11.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding:0 30px 0 0;\" alt=\"“Desert\">\nSurely this is on everyone’s list? If not, it should be. It has been going forever. You can even delve into the BBC archive and listen to interviews from decades ago.

The first series was all about Watergate, and the second series covered the Clinton / Monica Lewinsky affair. The first season in particular was gripping.

				"content_text": "<p>Today is the 15th March - The Ides of March. </p>\n<p>It became significant as the date of the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. </p>\n<p>For World War II buffs, it’s also significant as a fateful day for Europe. On this day in 1939 Hitler’s troops began the occupation of the rest of Czechoslovakia, ending the pretence of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement\">Munich Agreement</a>. Nazi Germany had annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia the previous October and promised the Western Powers that this would be the last of his territorial demands. They fell for it.</p>\n<p>It could be said that this was the beginning of the end for Hitler. From this point forward the road to war was inevitable. German troops marched in from the west and Hungarian troops moved into Ruthenia from the east. By the end of the day Czechoslovakia ceased to exist as a sovereign state.</p>\n<p>Neither Britain nor France made the slightest move to intervene, even though at Munich they had provided Czechoslovakia with a guarantee against aggression.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting reading about this period, and particularly the response in Britain. Not long before, Britain’s Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had been lauded as a peacemaker. The Times and Daily Mail newspapers in particular had shown admiration for Hitler. Even after the 15th March the Daily Mail took its time to renounce Hitler. Of course, Winston Churchill new better.</p>\n",

				"title": "A Year with the Apple HomePod",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9b7e998dbe.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n<p>When Apple finally released the HomePod on the 9th Feb 2018 it didn’t take me long to buy one. I had looked at the Google Home and Amazon Echo with curiosity, but was never really tempted. I’m an Apple Music subscriber for one, and I was also reluctant to put an Amazon or Google listening device in my home. I’ve got serious concerns over privacy, and it’s only Apple that have been able to allay those concerns. That’s not my inner Apple fanboy talking, I’ve read Apple’s support papers on privacy and security. </p>\n<p>Prior to the HomePod, I had been using a Sonos Play:1. The Sonos audio quality is generally good, but every now and again there’s a notable distortion. Only on songs with strong levels of bass, but it happens even when the volume is at mid-levels. The other problem I have with the Sonos is the integration with Apple Music, namely the lack of support for Smart Playlists. I use Smart Playlists extensively within iTunes and to get around the lack of support in Sonos I’ve had to periodically manually copy songs from my smart playlist to dedicated manual playlists for the Sonos. Not ideal. The Sonos has now been relegated to the bedroom. I appreciate my Sonos Play:1 is pretty old now so many of the issues have probably been resolved with newer versions. I believe you can even integrate the new Sonos smart speakers with Siri.</p>\n<p>After using the HomePod for a full year my thoughts are pretty much the same as they were after the first month of use. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-basics\">The Basics</h2>\n<p>First of all, the sound quality is excellent. You don’t need to be an audiophile to tell this delivers crisp, clear sound at an amazing volume for such a small unit.</p>\n<p>Second, the microphones are unbelievable. For Siri to hear my commands when I’m speaking at normal volume and music is booming out is quite frankly, witchcraft.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smart-speaker\">Smart Speaker</h2>\n<p>A lot has been written about the smart speaker capability, particularly in comparison to the Google Assistant on the Google Home and Alexa on the Amazon Echo. It’s true that Siri is not leading the way in this regard. I find that Siri does the job, most of the time, and it is slowly getting better.</p>\n<p>To be frank, all the virtual assistants are shit. All of them have problems with understanding context. It’s early days and I’m sure we’re going to see amazing leaps in AI over the next few years, but at the moment we’re a long way from the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/\">Her</a> days. </p>\n<p>The technorati on blogs and YouTube get hung up with smart speaker comparisons. In reality, is the average joe even using voice commands on a regular basis? Let’s face it, talking to an inanimate object feels weird.</p>\n<p>Still, I can say “Hey Sir, play me something I like”, and pretty much without fail, music that I like starts playing. It helps that over the years I’ve obsessively rated thousands of songs in my iTunes library. At first I thought that Siri was just selecting music from my library that I’ve given a a high rating. That is the case, but it’s also mixed with songs that i know aren’t in my library, and seems to match my tastes quite well.</p>\n<p>The only caveat to that is that I don’t live on my own and the music tastes of my wife and daughter also get factored in. At the moment there’s no way to use multiple accounts with the HomePod. Apple have said that will come, but for now Rach and Lauren can play music, and the music they select influences Siri’s learning. You can turn it off in settings. In fact, I probably should turn it off - that should stop Dolly Parton songs interrupting my music sessions!</p>\n<h2 id=\"podcasts\">Podcasts</h2>\n<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts and for some reason I couldn’t get my podcasts to play on the HomePod. If I asked Siri to play a specific podcast, it would play. If I asked Siri to play my most recent podcast, Siri would tell me ‘You’re not subscribed to any podcasts”. I am. It drove me insane. I subscribe to shit loads of podcasts. I listen to podcasts pretty much every day. </p>\n<p>I’m guessing the issue has something to do with the fact I have seperate Apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes content. It’s an issue that goes back to the days of MobileMe. For some reason we had to create a new account for MobileMe and couldn’t use our existing iTunes ID. Eventually, MobileMe got replaced by iCloud and even though Apple has hinted in the past that they’re working on a fix to allow customers to merge Apple IDs, it’s now 2019 and that fix is nowhere in sight. </p>\n<p>Setting up the HomePod was a breeze. You just hold up your iPhone close to the HomePod and it automatically transfers all the settings over. This is the crux of the problem I reckon. I think it was trying to use my iCloud account for podcasts even though on my iPhone I’m signed in with my other Apple ID for iTunes.</p>\n<p>You may notice I’m using the past tense. I gave up on the Apple Podcasts app and now use Overcast. I finally gave up with Apple Podcasts when the Apple Podcasts integration on the Apple Watch with iOS 12 failed to meet expectations. That’s another rant for another day.</p>\n<p>For now, if I want to play a podcast on my HomePod I just Airplay it. So old school I know!</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I’m happy with the HomePod and considering buying another one to try out stereo sound with the Apple TV. We’ve recently moved to a new apartment with stone tiled floors, so the acoustics are pretty terrible when watching TV using the in-built TV speakers. The HomePod sound seems to compensate for the acoustics in a way that is much more noticeable than I remember at our old place. Stereo HomePods could be the (pricy) answer. Alternatively, I might try a Soundbar. I hear the Sonos playbar is quite good!</p>\n",

Man Utd fans will pick Scholes. Chelsea fans will pick Lampard and Liverpool fans will say Steven Gerrard. Neutrals will vary between the three and the argument will go on and on in the pub and between the pundits on TV for years.</p>\n<p>As a Liverpool fan I’m going to say Gerrard, of course I am, but I honestly believe there’s no contest.</p>\n<p>Don’t take my word for it. Ask Peter Crouch, who's played with just about everyone. Crouchy devotes a whole chapter to Steven Gerrard in his recent book ‘How to be a Footballer’. Here’s what he had to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the skills Gerrard had! People would say to me, Xabi Alonso is the best passer of a football I’ve ever seen. I’d say, yeah, but Stevie is better. They’d tell me that Claude Makélélé was the best tackler. Yeah, but Stevie’s better. Lampard is the best goal-scoring midfielder. Yup, Stevie’s on a par with him. He could play right-back and left-back. He could play centre midfield, he could play off the striker. He could play centre-forward and he could dominate totally from right midfield. It’s only when you train with a player that you realise quite how good they are. On match-day you would see Thierry Henry and Gianfranco Zola producing little miracles. With Gerrard they were a daily occurrence. He was by far the best player in England training, and that includes David Beckham, Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen. I never trained with Paul Scholes; our times in the national set-up did not overlap. But the Chelsea lads would say the same thing: Gerrard is the most naturally gifted player we’ve worked with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The documentary <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9206562/\">Make Us Dream</a> (available on Amazon Prime) about Stevie’s career is good, but it doesn’t really cover anything new. </p>\n<p>If like me, you’ve read his two autobiographies, watched the documentary about him when he released his first autobiography, and the many since that have been on LFC TV, and also watched countless highlights packages on YouTube put together by fans, you will be familiar with the script. </p>\n<p>The standard highlights and lowlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banging goals in from 30 yards</li>\n<li>Tough tackling</li>\n<li>The great goals against Manchester United</li>\n<li>That goal against Olympiakos that meant Liverpool qualified out of the group stage of the Champions League (the year they won it)</li>\n<li>That goal in the Champions League final that inspired the famous comeback</li>\n<li>Signing for Chelsea, and then not signing for Chelsea</li>\n<li>The FA Cup Final screamer against West Ham</li>\n<li>'We Go Again’ at the end of the game where Liverpool beat Manchester City near the end of the 2013/14 season when we were challenging for the title</li>\n<li>That slip against Chelsea two games later that led to Liverpool conceding a goal (people forget that Liverpool lost that game 0-2, not 0-1).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What all these compilations of Stevie’s career miss, and what’s hard to purvey unless you’ve sat and watched every game, is the sheer number of games when he carried Liverpool. All those seasons when we just qualified for the Champions League, or managed to win a trophy even though we were nowhere to be seen in the Premier League title race, it was Stevie who made the difference more times than not. He was a playmaker and a match winner. He drove the side forward. He brought the game to life when we were struggling. He kept us in games we seemed destined to lose. Owen, Torres, Suarez - all fantastic strikers during the Gerrard era - and all say that they wouldn’t have scored so many goals without Stevie offering the supply.</p>\n<p>We now watch from a distance to see how his new career pans out as a manager at Rangers. Waiting, and hoping, for that day in a few years, after Klopp has finally ended the Premier League drought and built a new dynasty, when Stevie takes the reins as Liverpool manager.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The continuing decline of the Royal Navy is a travesty. Today, it'a a shadow of its former self.</p>\n<p>When I joined the RN in 1991, the numbers, both in ships and manpower, were on the decline. This was expected. The cold war had just ended, Saddam Hussein was under containment after his adventure into Kuwait, and there were no major threats on the horizon. We didn't know it at the the time but we were entering a decade of relative peace.</p>\n<p>Despite the relative peace of the 90s, the RN was stretched. Playing a leading role behind the US, we had commitments across the globe. Constant NATO operations between alliance navies, the Armilla Patrols in the Persian Gulf, anti-drug operations in the Caribbean and elsewhere, UN resolution enforcement in the Adriatic Sea during the Bosnian and Kosovo conflicts, UK maritime protection, as well as protection of UK overseas dependancies such as Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. If that wasn't enough, there were the constant 'flag-waving' visits supporting Britain's efforts to bolster international trade all over the world. </p>\n<p>Then 9/11 happened and it changed everything, except, the RN continued to decline.</p>\n<img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9bd19a00d1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"442\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>In 1982, when Margaret Thatcher gave the order to liberate the Falkland Islands, the RN was able to put together a task force of 115 ships. This included two aircraft carriers (HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible) with a full complement of fighter jets, and 23 destroyers and frigates.</p>\n\n<p>During the 90's, we maintained three aircraft carriers - HMS Ark Royal, HMS Invincible and HMS Illustrious, which took turns in operational deployments so we always had at least one flagship carrier at sea, and often two. I was on HMS Invincible for 3 years. </p>\n\n<p>Later, HMS Ocean joined the fleet as our largest amphibious assault ship - capable of carrying up to 18 helicopters and 800 marines for landing operations.  </p>\n\n<p>Compare that with today. The continued budgets cuts under both Labour and Conservative governments has decimated the RN, at a time when commitments have only increased. </p>\n\n<p>HMS Invincible was decommissioned in 2005, followed by HMS Ark Royal in 2011, and HMS Illustrious in 2014. Their replacements, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, are much bigger and more capable ships, but they are not due to be operational until 2020 and 2023 respectively.</p>\n\n<p>So at the moment we have HMS Ocean as the flagship and even she is now going to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-34909649\">decommissioned in 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In total, we are now down to 77 commissioned ships, but that doesn't tell the whole store. The 77 includes:\n   - HMS Ocean (LPD)\n   - 6 destroyers\n   - 13 frigates\n   - 4 ballistic nuclear submarines\n   - 7 attack submarines\n   - 2 assault ships\n   - 15 minesweepers\n   - 22 patrol vessels\n   - 4 survey vessels\n   - 1 icebreaker\n   - 2 historic warships (HMS Victory and HMS Bristol).</p>\n\n<p>Roughly half of the ships are in routine maintenance, refit or sea acceptance training at any given time, and manpower shortages means the Navy is constantly under stress. 9-month long deployments are now becoming the norm, and it's largely believed that the decision to axe HMS Ocean is as a direct result of the need to provide sailors to man HMS Queen Elizabeth.</p>\n\n<p>The UK defence budget in total has declined from over 4% of GDP in 1990 down to 2% today (the NATO minimum). In terms of manpower, the RN is down to just 30,000, compared to 39,000 in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>The government has finally admitted that the continued cuts under the Strategic Defence Reviews (SDR) means Britain can't keep its commitments, and has begun quietly withdrawing from the world. </p>\n\n<p>The RN was playing a leading roll in combating piracy off Somalia and the wider East African coast. That ended in 2012 when the government withdrew the permanent role. Then, this year, after a continued 34 years of presence in the South Atlantic, the RN no longer has a permanent warship patrolling the Falkland Islands to deter Argentinian aggression.</p>\n\n<p>The loss of sea-borne air power has also been an embarrassment for the Government. Shortly after the Sea Harrier squadrons were retired in 2010, the UK launched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ellamy\">Operation Ellamy</a> in 2011 to participate in the military intervention in Libya. We then had one aircraft carrier (HMS Illustrious) with no combat jets, so had to rely on the RAF flying Typhoons and Tornados out of Gioia del Colle in Italy and RAF bases at home.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after, Islamic State fighters started sweeping through northwestern Iraq. The US and French navies deployed aircraft carriers to launch air strikes and the Royal Navy had nothing to offer. </p>\n\n<p>When questioned about the continued cuts the government points to the ship-building programs underway. Again, this tells its own story. The 12 Type-42 destroyers are being replaced with just 6 Type 45s (the programme is already delayed and will not be completed until the mid 2020s). The 12 Swiftsure and Trafalgar class submarines are being replaced with just seven new Astute class subs. The 13 Type-23 frigates are being replaced by 8 Type-26 Global Combat Ships and 5 (for now) type 31s, but there are concerns that lighter Type-31 General Purpose Frigates (GPFF) may not be able to offer the same level of protection.</p>\n\n<p>As for the the new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, they will surely be the pride of the Royal Navy. These are huge 70,000-ton carriers, second only in size to the US Nimitz-class super-carriers. As a comparison, HMS Invincible only displaced 20,000 tons. </p>\n\n<p>However, whether the F35B Joint Striker Fighter will be ready for deployment on HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2020 is still doubtful given the continued, well documented <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/26/most-expensive-weapon-ever-built-limps-toward-finish-line.html\">problems with the most expensive weapons system every built</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, aircraft carriers need escorts and support vessels to form the carrier battle group. An aircraft carrier on its own can't sustain itself for very long and has limited means to defend itself. With the surface combat fleet now numbering only 19 (frigates and destroyers), and with usually only a third on active operations at any one time, HMS Queen Elizabeth is going to monopolise most of the fleet.</p>\n\n<p>All in all it's a sad situation and begs the question what role Britain wants to play, and is capable of playing, under its responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, particularly with post-BREXIT uncertainty causing the pound to plummet and risk the return to strong economic growth.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.savetheroyalnavy.org\">Save the Royal Navy</a>.</p><p>Header image attribution: BAE Systems - <a href=\"http://www.defenceimages.mod.uk/\">www.defenceimages.mod.uk</a></p>\n",

				"title": "How to Solve a Problem Like Islamic State",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>When something tragic like what unfolded in Paris happens, we all have an opinion on what needs to be done. Well here’s mine - I’m going to play armchair general and pretend I know what I’m talking about.\nIt seems to me that the strategy for containing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh, whatever you want to call them, isn’t working. Nobody in their right minds believes that IS is going to be defeated with a bombing campaign or drone strikes. In fact, many argue, including myself, that airstrikes are counter-productive. How many innocent civilians have been killed from collateral damage in the last 12 months? How many moderate muslims have been radicalised as a result?</p>\n<p>So here’s my 5-point plan for tackling IS:</p>\n<h3>1. Send in ground troops and rebuild Syria</h3>\n<p>Nobody wants another Middle-East war. While the Afghanistan War was inevitable after 9/11, it’s pretty clear now that the Iraq War was a foreign policy disaster. You can argue about whether it was the war in general that was a mistake, or simply the post-invasion planning. Nevertheless, there is no hope of any diplomatic solution with IS. No one is going to invite IS leaders to the UN or any other forum to discuss peace terms. There is no negotiating with IS. The only option is to eliminate them, even if that means cooperating with Russia and leaving Assad in place temporarily. Dealing with Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad will have to wait.</p>\n<p>A sound military plan has to go hand in hand with a strategic recovery plan. We cannot have a repeat of the Iraq War. The US may take the lead with the military objectives but it would be wise if the US takes a backseat when it comes to rebuilding Syria. The UN, supported by other Middle East countries, must take the lead in bringing democracy to Syria. A new government in Syria will never be trusted if Syrians believe that it is a puppet of the US.</p>\n<h3>2. Ethical foreign policy</h3>\n<p>We need to stop supporting and selling arms to despotic regimes that support and fund terrorism - I’m looking at you Saudi Arabia. This goes to the wider policy of \"anything goes as long as it means jobs and economic growth”. It seems madness that we count on Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other countries in the region as key allies in the war on terrorism while knowing that they play both sides. You hear the argument that if we don’t sell missiles to Saudi Arabia then Russia or China will. This is what I mean by ethical foreign policy - we should do things because they are right, even if BAE loses some arms contracts and jobs are lost.</p>\n<p>A proxy war is playing out in the Middle East between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and it’s spreading. For years we thought the Shia Islamic militants backed by Iran were the biggest danger. It’s clear now that IS, backed by fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam, which has its roots in Saudi Arabia, is taking jihadism to a whole new level. With oil prices low and showing no signs of rising with the world moving to renewables, Saudi Arabia have already indicated that they need to start diversifying their economy. Therefore the Saudi royal family have a choice to make - do they risk foreign investment by failing to tackle fundamentalism, or do they bow to the clerics (who are the real power in Saudi Arabia) and continue turning a blind eye to IS.</p>\n<h3>3. Abandon the Schengen Agreement and overhaul the refugee programme.</h3>\n<p>Borderless travel around Europe is fantastic but one of the European Union’s greatest advantages is also one of its biggest vulnerabilities. The UK was right to opt-out. I have little time for the those in Australia, UK and the US who say close up shop and close the borders to refugees. Surely if you support your government taking military action in Syria then your country also has a moral obligation to take in refugees as a result of the military action. That being said, when the numbers are in the hundreds of thousands it’s inevitable that some terrorists are going to slip through. As a minimum Europe needs to adopt a strictly controlled refugee programme that isolates refugees to specific countries until they can be returned to their country of origin, or until their asylum application is approved.</p>\n<p>The problem though is one of process. When you learn about the situation in the UN refugee camps and find out that it can take years for an application for asylum to be processed, you begin to understand why hundreds of thousands of refugees make the dangerous trip up through Turkey and into western Europe. Some of them are refugees who want to return to their country as soon as the war is over, and yes, others are economic migrants. We need to stop blaming the economic migrants for simply wanting to seek a better life, but at the same time accept that the levels of migration are fuelling nationalism and are having some genuine negative effects on communities. All countries need to ensure that the UNHCR is properly funded and resourced in order to cope with the refugee crisis and dramatically bring down processing times.</p>\n<h3>4. Tackle the Mosques, Islamic Community Centres, religious indoctrination of children and subjugation of Muslim women by Muslim men.</h3>\n<p>Overseas funding of mosques and Islamic community centres should be illegal. Yes, it would mean that the vast majority of legitimate non-radicalised mosques would lose funding because of the minority, but it needs to be done. This has already happened in Austria. I would also apply the same policy to all religious institutions so that the policy can’t be accused of unfairly targeting Islam. Religious indoctrination is despicable and must be stopped. At the same time moderate muslims need to do more to root out extremism. We see these Imams condemn violence and then immediately justify it by pointing to the root causes. It doesn’t matter if they have a point regarding the root causes, the message needs to be unequivocal that violence is not the answer.</p>\n<p>We also need to do more to address the endemic misogyny in many Muslim communities and families. There needs to be the right balance between religious tolerance and ensuring Muslims living in Western countries accept western values. Most of our countries now have laws against forced marriage, female genital mutilation, etc, yet these things still go on, and many Muslim men still dictate the future of the women in their lives. Within Australia, Muslim women have the lowest workplace participation, the highest rate of welfare dependency, and the lowest tertiary education participation.</p>\n<p>Finally, we should do more to stop the religious indoctrination of children. Learning about religious history and customs is one thing, forcing children to read the Bible or Quran as revealed truth is another thing entirely. It's crazy to me that this is still happening in 2015 in supposedly secular societies. We can't begin to tackle religious extremism without tackling religion. The politicians commonly trot out the same line that what we are seeing is a perversion of Islam, which is true to some extent, but we can't ignore the fact that jihad and martyrdom are concepts found in the Quran.</p>\n<h3>5. Address the root causes of muslim grievance</h3>\n<p>There is no justification for the actions of IS and Al Quaeda before them, but we can’t pretend that the rise in Islamic terrorism wasn’t borne from some genuine grievances and injustices.</p>\n<p>Until the Israel-Palestine problem is resolved we are never going to have peace in the Middle East. After all that has happened, statehood for Palestine looks further away than ever. Benjamin Netanyahu has taken a hardline stance, stoking up electoral support based on fear. The only country that can do something about this is the US. The US needs to use its considerable influence to force Israel to the negotiating table. Unfortunately, it’s not going to happen any time soon with a Republic majority in the US Senate.</p>\n<p>So there you have it, my 5-point plan. Of course, I’m only scratching the surface and I’m sure people wiser than I can easily point out the folly in my plan.</p>\n<h3>What not to do</h3>\n<p>Now to what should not be done. We should not give in to fear and allow governments to increase blanket surveillance and undermine encryption.</p>\n<p>We’re already seeing the Paris Attacks being used as justification for increasing the powers of the intelligence agencies and passing laws that further increase blanket surveillance. France recently passed some of the toughest surveillance laws in the world. What good did it do? Blanket surveillance, as opposed to targeted surveillance, has very little impact on disrupting terrorism. Even Obama’s hand-picked advisory panel to look into the bulk metadata collection program concluded that the program “was not essential to preventing attacks and could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional [court] orders”.</p>\n<p>I have no problems with governments increasing the budgets of the intelligence agencies - just use the larger budgets to increase the monitoring of genuine suspects, rather than invading the privacy of the rest of us. It seems after every attack we later find out that one or more of the perpetrators were ‘known’ to police or intelligence agencies.</p>\n<p>We must also never bow to the demands of David Cameron and others who want the intelligence agencies to have access to our encryption keys, or want back-doors to be placed in encryption mechanisms. This proposal is <a href=\"https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/45\">wrong, dangerous and technically infeasible</a> - encryption has long been out of the hands of any one government, industry or company.</p>\n",

I can't believe it's been years since we visited this beautiful part of South East Queensland - what were we thinking? It was a late decision to go away for the long weekend (Queen's Birthday public holiday) so we struggled to find accommodation. We ended up staying in The Sebel at Noosa Heads, which was so-so. Hastings St at Noosa seems to be a lot better than I remember. There are now fairly lights in all the trees the length of Hastings St which has made a massive difference. With all the restaurants, bars and boutique clothes stores the place looks great and has a fantastic atmosphere at night. Mind you, it's not a place to visit on a budget - there's a reason everyone looks like they have just stepped off a yacht in Cannes.</p><p>This photo was taken from Noosa National Park looking out into the bay during sunset.

However, it’s hard to review the movie without considering the source material.</p><p>I’ve read other reviews that criticises the film because it shows a one-sided view of Chris Kyle and fails to tackle the politics of the Iraq War. Those reviews don’t seem to understand that the film is based on Chris Kyle’s autobiography, so of course it’s going to be one-sided. As for the politics, anyone who has read the book is in no doubt about Chris Kyle’s politics and his feelings regarding the Iraq War.</p><p>Leaving the cinema I felt a lot of sympathy for Chris Kyle and, even though I’m not an American, felt he rightly deserved his label as an American hero. These are not the feelings I had after reading the book.</p><p>It’s hard to read the book objectively and not get the opinion that a) he was a complete psychopath who loved killing, and b) he was actually a bit of an arsehole.</p><p>That person doesn’t come across in the film. Of course, in a 2 hour movie you don’t have the time to linger on the never-ending sniper kills. In the book you get the feeling that Chris is treating it like a video game - sitting on high picking off one insurgent after the other.</p><p>This is also a guy who loved nothing more than going out to bars at weekends and getting into fights with the locals.</p><p>The film also fails to adequately capture the tension and arguments between him and his wife. I heard the phrase “God, Country, Family” mentioned once in the movie, whereas in the book it was a continuing focus of dispute, with Chris believing country and patriotism was more important than family, and his wife failing to understand how he can put his country before family. They both agreed that God came first, perhaps telling us a little about the role religion played in their lives.</p><p>Where I also take issue with the film is where the screenplay has taken dramatic licence with the story. The central arc of the movie revolves around the battles to capture or kill Mustafa, the deadly Syrian sniper picking off American soldiers. In truth this plays only a small role in the book and Chris Kyle has very little involvement with the missions to capture or kill Mustafa.</p><p>Bradley Copper is super as Chris Kyle and rightly deserves his oscar nomination. I was worried that the movie might give Chris more depth and complexity than what came across in the book. In this regard I believe Bradley Cooper’s portrayal was fairly accurate. My takeaway from the book was that Chris was brainwashed. The events of the Embassy bombings and 9/11, perhaps understandably, gave him a single-minded view of the Iraq war being a noble cause to protect Americans at home. There was no mention in the book or film about the dubious politics of the Iraq war. In Chris’s eyes, it was a simple tail of good against evil.</p><p>The movie is entertaining, dramatic and full of tense scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. However, if you want to understand the real Chris Kyle, read the book, and only then make up your own mind whether he really was an hero or simply a psychopath who was given an opportunity to legally kill hundreds of people.</p>\n",

If you're not familiar with Trey, he's a world-renowned landscape photographer and pioneer of High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography. He has a thriving business on the back of continually travelling the world creating stunning pictures. He has a huge social media following - over 11 million (more than Lady Gage), and has a fantastic business model - all of us can download any of his full-resolution images for free as long as it's not for commercial use - and there are no watermarks.</p>\n<p>I've been following him for a while and if my photos have started to improve lately, his tutorials are the reason.</p>\n<p>He flew into Brisbane this week for a brief visit to speak at a conference and arranged a photo walk of Brisbane through Google+. I attended along with about 150 others. It was quite a sight seeing 150 of us, all with camera gear and tripods, walk in pack around Brisbane. He was really friendly and took us through, in detail, his process for his style of photography.</p>\n<p>When you look at his portfolio you see he has some amazing skies in his photos. I asked him what he does on a photo shoot when the skies are clear blue and featureless - as is usually the case this time of year in Brisbane. I think he got what I was hinting at and he said straight off that he never does what some other photographers might do, which is mask in a sky from another photo using photoshop. I was glad to hear that because I think it's a bit disingenous if you're lucking at an amazing landscape photo which isn't the real deal.</p>\n<p>The main objective of the night was to shoot the <a href=\"http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/events/view/santos-glng-city-of-lights\">Santos City of Lights</a> from South Bank. It was quite a good show, if not a little shorter than I was expecting. I'll post some more of my pics from last night at a future data. The picture above is from the beginning of the evening, and shows the entrance to Brisbane Library. The colours and glass make the building particularly interesting, and I've tried to add to this by blending in different exposures and adding contrast and clarity to create a metallic finish. I saw Trey taking the same shot so I'll be interested to see what his version looks like. No doubt it will be amazing.</p>\n",

I'm so glad we hired a car because our little shit-mobile would never have made it!</p>\n<p>After staying in a hotel described on Tripadvisor as the Bates Motel (we actually liked it), we went to Dorrigo National Park and walked through the rainforest to the Crystal Shower Falls. </p>\n<p>There were no shortage of waterfalls to choose from but what's perhaps unique about this one is that you can actually walk behind it. If you look towards the bottom of the photo, that's a cave behind the falls that you can walk into and experience the might of that cascading water right in front of you. It was quite an experience.</p>\n",

I’m more than familar with the Premier Inn after spending many a night in them up and down the UK for work trips during my last main job in the UK.</p>\n<p>Rachelle was still coughing her guts up (bronchitis we would later learn), so after checking in, Rach confined herself to the hotel room for another day while I took Lauren to see Westminster Abbey. It was a wet, miserable grey day but that didn’t dampen my enthusiasm for getting in some more sightseeing. And after realising what she had missed out on by not joining my walk around Paris, I’m pleased to say Lauren was keen to see Westminster Abbey too.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Westminster Abbey was one of the places I never made it to when I lived in London. A big oversight on my part.</p>\n<p>The tour was fascinating, featuring a smorgasbord of Britain’s most historical figures. Westminster Abbey has been the site for coronations and royal funerals since 1066 and features literally hundreds of plaques and monuments honouring the great and good. Poet’s Corner in particular stands out as a reminder of the contribution British artists have made to English literature, honouring the masters such as Shakespeare, Dickens, Chaucer, Byron, T.S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas and many others. I hope they’re going to reserve a spot for Nick Hornby and Jeffrey Archer!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3bf5f7a813.jpg\" alt=\"Westminster Abbey\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Westminster_Abbey-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Westminster Abbey was our last sightseeing stop in London, and Europe. I returned with Lauren back to the hotel. That night we ate in the hotel’s Thyme pub restaurant. I’ve always had a soft-spot for the Premier Inn’s pub restaurants and this one didn’t disappoint. A last chance for some good ol’ pub grub and a ‘proper’ pint or two.</p>\n<p>The following day we caught the Heathrow Express and boarded a British Airways flight to Hong Kong.</p>\n<h2>Hong Kong</h2>\n<p>Hong Kong is one of those places that I’ve always wanted to visit. However, in hindsight, I think I got this part of the itinerary wrong. Instead of having the relaxing stop-off on Sentosa Island on the way out, we should have done it the other way round - Hong Kong sightseeing on the way out to Europe and Sentosa Island chill-out on the way back.</p>\n<p>By the time we arrived in Hong Kong, travel weariness had well and truly set in. Rachelle had been ill for the last few days and just wanted to get home, and even I was getting to the point of indifference - ‘Oh look, yet another beautiful iconic site’. I’ve always regretted not doing the year-long backpack around the word thing, but perhaps I’m not cut out for it after all. Or maybe staying in comfy hotels instead of youth hostels dulls some of the travel experience.</p>\n<p>For once we didn’t really have any itinerary for Hong Kong, just a list of places we would like to visit, including Victoria Peak and the Big Buddha, neither of which we ended up visiting.</p>\n<p>For our final stop on this month-long trip I had arranged for us to stay in the <a href=\"http://www.marcopolohotels.com/hotels/hongkong/kowloon/marco_polo_hongkong/index.html\">Marco Polo Hongkong Hotel</a>, which is actually in Kowloon. I chose the hotel for its location - in the vibrant Tsim Sha Tsui district, smack bang on Victoria Harbour facing across from the spectacular Hong Kong skyline.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t cheap but it wasn’t too expensive either given its location and facilities. It’s adjacent to the Star Ferry and adjoins the Harbour City shopping mall. We also had one of our best meals of the entire trip in the hotel’s buffet restaurant. We tend to shy away from buffet restaurants as it’s usually quantity over quality. Not so on this occasion.</p>\n<p>We arrived in Honk Kong on the Wednesday afternoon. In truth we could easily have caught the excellent public transport system to our hotel but after a 12 hour overnight flight (with no sleep), we avoided any chance of hassle and hopped in a taxi.</p>\n<p>That night and the following day was spent lazing around the hotel and wandering around Tsim Sha Tsui just taking it all in. I’d never previously visited China, or Hong Kong, so I was curious to what extent Hong Kong may have changed since Britain handed back control in 1997. From what I could tell, probably not much. Hong Kong still maintains a level of independence and autonomy under the ‘one country, two systems’ principle, and there is plenty of evidence of British influence from its 100-yr lease. It’s still one of the world’s leading financial centres and there’s no signs of a move away from capitalism. Everyone we spoke to spoke fluent English and all the signs were in both Chinese (don't ask me whether they were Mandarin or Cantonese) and English.</p>\n<p>If you’re wanting the authentic Chinese experience then Tsim Sha Tsui is probably not the place. It’s very much the Hollywood of Hong Kong, even with its very own walk of fame - the Avenue of Stars - featuring foot and hand prints of stars such as Jackie Chan, and most notably a statue of Bruce Lee.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d3d985f669.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Lee\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"bruce-lee-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>In the evening the highlight was watching the Symphony of Lights - a laser and light show set to music, beamed from the skyscrapers on the opposite side of Victoria Bay.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ad7ab842a4.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong Symphony of Lights\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Hong-Kong-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>On our final full day in Hong Kong I managed to convince Rach to join myself and Lauren for a trip across the bay on the Star Ferry. I couldn’t convince her to take the trip further up to Victoria Peak but I wasn’t too fussed. I had already settled on the fact that we were all too tired to appreciate Hong Kong and would have to wait for a return visit.</p>\n<p>While over in Hong Kong I couldn’t help myself - another Apple Store to tick off the list.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/36f7e306cb.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Store Hong Kong\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"apple-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>That evening we had another wander, taking in the sights and sounds around Victoria Harbour.</p>\n<p>On the final day we were to fly out in the evening so did a final bit of last-minute shopping in the morning. Like many other Asian cities, there's no shortage of malls. I was keen to get out of the malls though. After all, you see much more interesting things out on the streets.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/50eac95925.jpg\" alt=\"Nice hat 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"nice_hat-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:5px;\">Adapt and Survive!</div>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3d4fe6bed2.jpg\" alt=\"Wanko 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"wanko-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin:5px;\">Registered Trademark - yes I am a child.</div>\n<p>I regret not buying this, whatever it is:</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/11cc47f900.jpg\" alt=\"Lamb placenta\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"lamb_placenta-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>So in summary our brief stop-off in Hong Kong was not exactly as planned but it was definitely enough of a taster to make us want to return. I'll see you next time Big Buddha!</p>\n<h2>Home Sweet Home</h2>\n<p>The Qantas flight home is a blur. I'm sure we must have resembled zombies walking through security at Brisbane Airport.</p>\n<p>This was a dream trip in every way and normally coming home from holiday is a massive deflation. Things were a little different this time though. We weren't returning to dreary old England. We live in the Sunshine State. Coming home to warm sunshine and clear-blue skies soon washed away the post-holiday blues.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if it came across in these blog posts but I absolutely loved every minute of the trip. I only wish Rach had been in better shape for the last week.</p>\n<p>The trip was the result of months of planning. It wasn't cheap either. We could have bought a new car with what we spent on this little adventure. We still drive around in our old banger. No regrets though, there's no way I would trade in the experiences for a new car. The memories of the trip will last forever. A new car depreciates as soon as you drive it off the forecourt.</p>\n",

Anyway….\nThe rail journey from Grindelwald to Paris wasn’t quite as spectacular as from Venice to Grindelwald, but it was still a great way to travel. This time we caught a German Deutsche Bahn inter-city train. It ticked all the boxes - fast, on-time, clean, laptop charging points, well-stocked buffet, etc. Sometimes I sit and imagine I’m on that train now when I travel to work with Queensland Rail. Unfortunately my imagination isn’t that great. The smell of stale piss, muscle cramps from lack of room, and shivering from the air-conditioning being cranked up to −5 degrees usually snaps me out of that little daydream.</p>\n<div class=\"in-post-widget\">\n<h3>Trip Series Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/942/europe-trip-2012-part-1\">Part 1: The Planning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/970/europe-trip-2012-part-2-sentosa-island\">Part 2: Sentosa Island</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1002/europe-trip-2012-part-3-london\">Part 3: London</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1031/europe-trip-2012-part-4-family-and-friends\">Part 4: Friends and Family</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1049/europe-trip-2012-part-4-venice\">Part 5: Venice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1066/europe-trip-2012-part-6-grindelwald\">Part 6: Grindelwald</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1108/europe-trip-2012-part-7-paris\">Part 7: Paris</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2930/europe-trip-2012-part-8-london-hong-kong-home\">Part 8: London - Hong Kong - Home</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>We arrived at Paris Gare Lyon station mid-afternoon and caught a taxi to our hotel. We had booked to stay in the hotel <a href=\"http://www.adagio-city.com/gb/hotel-6790-adagio-paris-tour-eiffel/index.shtml\">Adagio Paris Tour Eiffel</a>, which was only a short distance walk from the Eiffel Tower. The hotel itself was fine, nothing special. We had a partial view of the Eiffel Tower which looks spectacular at night when lit up.</p>\n<p>I had a full itinerary planned for Paris. I had already purchased the <a href=\"http://www.conciergerie.com/paris/pass/paris-combo-pass-lite.php\">Paris Combo Pass</a> which included use of public transport and access to the Louvre Museum. As we arrived in Paris though it was looking increasingly like I’d be experiencing Paris on my own. The trip up to the freezing conditions at Jungfraujoch the day before had took its toll on Rach and she was now even worse.</p>\n<p>I had planned to start doing touristy stuff as soon as we arrived but it was clear that Rach was going nowhere. So instead we had a walk to a local supermarket, picked up some food and wine, and spent the evening in the apartment. Walking around the supermarket in Paris further re-affirmed how bad the supermarkets in Australia are. ¢1.99 for quite a decent bottle of Bordeaux. Paris was quickly becoming one of my favourite places!</p>\n<p>After a good night’s rest I set off early on Saturday morning to begin my sightseeing. For the first time on the trip I was on my own. Rach was confined to her death bed and Lauren decided she would rather stay in the apartment than traipse around museums with me.</p>\n<p>I hopped on a local bus and made my way over to the Louvre. I’d timed it right. If I’d have gone to the Louvre on the Sunday morning I could have got in free (the first Sunday of the month is always free entry). Whenever I see the word Free it immediately conjures up one image - Queues. This was my first time in Paris and I would happily pay to avoid standing in queues to get access to what is the most visited tourist attraction in the world. I had no desire to spend half a morning in a queue like I did with Rach when we visited the Vatican museum during our weekend away to Rome a few years ago.</p>\n<p>I arrived at the Louvre just after opening time at 9am, and was amazed to find no queues - I walked straight in. Already armed with my Rick Steves audio guide I made my way to the Denon Wing. I could have spent the entire weekend in the Louvre and not seen everything, such is the size and scope of the Louvre, so I’d already decided to limit myself to the highlights.</p>\n<p>The Louvre is the oldest and largest museum in Europe. It’s actually a 16th-Century palace arranged in a U-shape, and now adorned with a glass pyramid - a landmark for fans of The Da Vinci Code.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f65b44ddaf.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Louvre\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Louvre-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The building itself is beautiful - a fitting home for some of the world’s most celebrated and important works of art.</p>\n<p>My tour of the Denon Wing started in Ancient Greece. I was greeted by the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. I was also greeted by a hundred snap-happy Japanese tourists, all with matching baseball caps.</p>\n<p>I meandered through the Gallery of Statues (far too many statues of naked Greek people to mention) and gazed upon the Parthenon Friezes - slabs of decorated stone that once decorated the exterior of the 5th Century B.C. Parthenon. It struck me that I once visited the relics of the Parthenon in Athens while I was in the Navy and was utterly bored by the occasion, yet this time i was fascinated by a few slabs of stone from it. How times had changed. To think all the places I visited in the Navy and never really saw anything because I was young, stupid and only interested in seeing the bottom of a beer glass.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7b25636949.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Louvre\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Louvre-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>From Ancient Greece I travelled to 18th Century France in the Apollo Gallery - home to the crown jewels of Louis XV, Louis XVI and Napoleon.</p>\n<p>After a quick diversion past religious artwork from medieval Europe brought me to the Grand Gallery, home to famous pieces by Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo and of course, Leonardo Da Vinci.</p>\n<p>I doubt I’m alone in thinking that the Mona Lisa is perhaps the least spectacular piece of work in the Grand Gallery. Some of the other pieces are truly spectacular in scale and beauty, such as The Marriage at Cana by Paulo Veronese and the Winged Victory by Delacroix.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/32c2b517e5.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Louvre\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Louvre-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After seeing those it was a bit of a disappointment to finally make it to La Joconde (Mona Lisa). The painting is quite small, dark and protected behind a glass wall which is forever reflecting a hundred camera flashes, meaning that you have to get right up to the glass to view her properly, and to do that you have to battle your way past a thousand Asian tourists. It amazed me how many tourists (you know the ones I’m talking about) would finally get to the front of the queue, look at the Mona Lisa through the viewfinder of their camera, take the photo, and then walk away without actually ever viewing her with their naked retina. Unbelievable!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7c45bf8d16.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Louvre - Mona Lisa\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Louvre-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I spent perhaps another hour in the Denon Wing but it was getting far too busy for my liking so I said goodbye to the Louvre and set off on foot to the next stop on my itinerary.</p>\n<p>After a quick detour to a nearby cafe with free wi-fi, I walked down the river Seine to do the Historic Paris walking tour in the centre of Paris. Actually, the self-guided tour did in fact start at not just the centre of Paris, but the centre of France - Point Zero - this point from which all distances in France are measured.</p>\n<p>The Île de la Cité is an island in the Seine River that is the original birthplace of Paris, and is home to the Notre Dame Cathedral.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2c1d48a039.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Notre Dame 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Notre-Dame-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The island was fairly busy; as well as the usual throng of tourists to see the historic sights there was some kind of Emergency Services open-day on. The police, fire service, bomb detection squad and others were all set up displaying their kit.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/df6c39d82f.jpg\" alt=\"Paris bomb disposal engineer\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-bomb-disposal-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After a wander around the exterior of the Notre Dame I considered my options. I really wanted to go in and have a look around but the queue to get in was absolutely enormous. It had started raining but that seemed to have no effect on the size of the queue.</p>\n<p>I decided to miss out this time and instead went to the side entrance to join the smaller queue to get up to the top of the bell tower.</p>\n<p>I’m glad I did. Despite the awful weather I got to see some great Gargoyle-eye views of Paris.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/302876b537.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Notre Dame view\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Notre-Dame-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/633857373b.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Notre Dame view\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Notre-Dame-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a911343b4e.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Notre Dame view\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Notre-Dame-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After a further wander around Île de la Cité, including a look at the bird-shit spattered statue of Charlemagne, I walked across a love-lock infested bridge to find the nearest Metro station.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7f4b04c7a5.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Charlamagne Statue\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Charlamagne-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4636ec70fe.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Bridge Love Locks\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Bridge-Love-Locks-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a586fbd48.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Bridge Love Locks 2\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Bridge-Love-Locks-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>It was now late afternoon and I was tired, wet and hungry.</p>\n<p>By the time I got back to the apartment Rach was looking a little bit better so she braved a venture out with Lauren and I for food. The original plan was for some fine French dining but Rach was in no condition for that so we walked to the nearest brasserie that would let us in without a table booking.</p>\n<p>The following day had a fully packed itinerary. This time Rach and Lauren came out with me. Rach still looked like death so I new she wouldn’t be able to last long. We walked over to the Eiffel Tower - about a 15 min walk from our hotel with the intention of going up it. One look at the queue however and that plan quickly went out the window.</p>\n<p>Instead, we walked across the river to place du Trocadèro, perhaps the best place in Paris to get photos of the Eiffel Tower. It’s at this point that Rach realised there was no way she was going to be able to spend the day walking around Paris so she headed back to the apartment. I asked Lauren if she wanted to stay with me but she chose to return to the apartment as well - she’s not a walker. When we talk about it now she regrets that decision - particularly when I show here photos of everything she missed.</p>\n<p>Tripod and camera in hand I set up shop to try and get some decent pics.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/513f2b16ef.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Eiffel Tower\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Eiffel-Tower-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d19113e8e8.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Eiffel Tower\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Eiffel-Tower-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After the Eiffel Tower the next step on my itinerary was the Arc de Triomphe. I took the metro directly from Place du Trocadèro to the Arc de Triomphe which is at the top of the Champs-Elysée.</p>\n<p>I joined a short queue and paid to climb the 284 steps up the spiral staircase to the top of the Arc de Triomphe. My knees were taking a pounding by this point - still aching from the climb to the top of the Notre Dame bell tower the day before.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1fc748910a.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe Stair Climb\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Before you climb out onto the roof of the Arc de Triomphe there’s the obligatory gift shop and a small mezzanine area with exhibits explaining the history of the monument, which has played a pivotal role in French history. I could picture 1940 and the Nazis goose-stepping down the Champs-Elysées and under the Arc du Triomphe which was blazoned with a huge swastika.</p>\n<p>The view from the top is spectacular in all directions. Apparently Paris is roughly the same size has all the parks in London combined. Fill this with 11 million people and you can see why Paris has the highest population density of any city in Europe.</p>\n<p>In every direction you can see an iconic part of Paris. Looking east you can gaze straight down the Champs-Elysées to the Tuileries Garden and the Louvre. Further to the left and in the distance is the white dome of Sacré-Coeur. To the right in the distance is the Notre-Dame.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/194d878ea4.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fe42db58d1.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 5\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-5.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eae92fb458.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 3\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Looking west you can see the huge, rectangular Grande Arche de la Défense amongst a few skyscrapers.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3c723d9f76.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 4\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Looking down you can see that the Arc de Triomphe sits at the intersection of 12 boulevards, a masterpiece of city planning by Baron Haussmann. At this time on a Sunday morning the roads weren’t too busy but you could image the chaos of this area on a Friday afternoon.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/74f25dbead.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe view 2\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-view-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The climb back down the Arc de Triomphe brought me out directly underneath to see the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/44490a6d93.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-Tomb-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/39e8dc65fb.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Arc De Triomphe\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Arc-De-Triomphe-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I took a steady walk down the Champs-Elysées stopping a number of times to check out some of the glitzy stores. Amongst them were flagship stores for Peugeot and Mercedez-Benz which were more like museums than car showrooms.</p>\n<p>Further down the Champs-Elysées brought me to the beautiful Grand and Petit Palais exhibition halls, adjacent to statues of Charles de Gaulle and Winston Churchill.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/414532165e.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Petit Palais\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Petit-Palais-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>From here it was a short walk down the tree-lined avenue to Place de la Concorde.</p>\n<p>During the French Revolution, Place de la Concorde was home to a guillotine. Now the most famous structure is the 3,300-year-old obelisk of Luxor which sits directly over the spot where Louis XVI and 2779 others were beheaded. When the monarchy was restored in the 1830s after Napoleon, Louis XVI’s brother, Charles X, had the obelisk shipped from Egypt and erected to honour those who had lost their head.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/68c1e651ee.jpg\" alt=\"Place de la Concorde\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Place-de-la-Concorde-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Today the Place de la Concorde is a major tourist trap and great for photos. Another spot popular for wedding pics.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/50493a8246.jpg\" alt=\"Place de la Concorde\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Place-de-la-Concorde-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b9ef74af18.jpg\" alt=\"Place de la Concorde 4\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Place-de-la-Concorde-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6cc855ed37.jpg\" alt=\"Place de la Concorde 3\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Place-de-la-Concorde-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>From the Place de la Concorde I walked through the Tuileries Garden. A beautiful place for a Sunday stroll. This is where the Parisians come to relax, play boules and chill out by the pond.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4760b1de49.jpg\" alt=\"Tulleries Garden\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Tulleries-Garden-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ff0b7a7819.jpg\" alt=\"Tulleries Garden 2\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Tulleries-Garden-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The walk through the Tuileries Garden brought me back to the Louvre.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/75661de3ea.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Musee de Louvre\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Musee-de-Louvre-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>From here I walked across the river to the Left Bank. By this time it was getting towards late afternoon and I was ready for a little refreshment. Like an oasis in the desert a Scottish pub appeared before me down a side street.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/05aadfd8f4.jpg\" alt=\"Paris pub\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-pub-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After a swift pint or two I left the pub to take a self-guided tour of the Left Bank area.</p>\n<p>The Left Bank is historically famous for great artists and thinkers, and with that my tour began at the statue of Voltaire, the famous writer and philosopher.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ea366e5b57.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Voltaire\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Voltaire-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>A walk past galleries and boutique stores, all closed, brought me to L’Hotel at 13 rue des Beax-Arts. It was here, on the 30th November 1900, where Oscar Wilde died of an ear-infection, alone in a shabby hotel room after released from prison and rejected by his wife.</p>\n<p>Around the corner I came across the house where the German composer Richard Wagner spent the winter of 1841–1842 writing the opera that launched his career - The Flying Dutchmen.</p>\n<p>A walk through the square where the painter Eugène Delacroix lived brought me in to the heart of the Left Bank district, home to a great assortment of cafes and restaurants. By this time the evening was setting in and the area was getting busy.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/40086533e3.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Left Bank\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Left-Bank-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>My walk took me past Café le Procope, one of the world’s oldest continuously operating restaurants. Le Procope was founded in 1686 and was one of the first places in Europe where you could get a coffee - recently imported form the Middle East. Apparently, Voltaire was known to drink 30 cups a day here, Benjamin Franking loved to spend hours here recounting war stories from the American Revolution, and a young lieutenant named Napoleon Bonaparte ran up a tab here that he never paid.</p>\n<p>Further into the Left Bank brought me to Les Deux Magots Café and Le Café de Flore, famously frequented by such luminaries as Picasso, Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Oscar Wilde and other ‘free thinkers’ If you’ve seen Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris you’ll get the idea.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23e48dde46.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Left Bank\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Left-Bank-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Across from Café de Flore is Brasserie Lipp, the brasserie where Hemingway wrote much of A Farewell to Arms.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0b6ede37ec.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Left Bank\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Left-Bank-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I enjoyed my history tour of the Left Bank but I was getting hungry. I found a Brasserie that didn’t look too busy or too expensive and grabbed a quick bite before heading back to the apartment. Before heading back though I made sure to stop off and buy a bag of Macaroons to take back to Rach and Lauren.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23b0903438.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Macaroons\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Paris-Macaroons-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>That was the end of a great weekend (for me at least) in Paris. It was only a small taster and one day I hope to return to see more of the City of Light. I just hope next time Rachelle and Lauren will be able to share the experience with me.</p>\n<p>The next day we would be catching the Eurostar back to London for one final night in Europe.</p>\n",

Our train from Venice St. Lucia was due to leave at 07:50 but we made sure we left with plenty of time to spare. Getting to the station on the water bus wouldn’t be a problem. Finding the water bus in the first place would be. In my defence, the streets were very dimly lit, there was no one around to ask directions, the map was too high level to show the water bus pickup point we needed to get, and I had no data left on my phone.</p>\n<p>To get to Grindelwald in Switzerland we had to catch four trains: Venice to Milan, Milan to Spiez, Spiez to Interlaken, and finally Interlaken to Grindelwald. This was one of the main reasons I wanted to travel light. Unfortunately, I was travelling with two females so my request fell on deaf ears.</p>\n<p>Luckily we had no problems. In fact, travelling by rail in Europe is an absolute joy, we loved every minute of it. Travelling through Northern Italy past the Italian Lakes and up into the Swiss Alps must surely be one of the best rail journeys in the world.</p>\n<p>I was all set up with a beer and some movies on my iPad but who needs an iPad when you have those views.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6d9e6da05d.jpg\" alt=\"View of Northern Italy from the train\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"IMG_2168.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>We eventually arrived in Grindelwald mid-afternoon. Grindelwald was everything we had hoped for and more. We stepped off the train into cool, fresh mountain air and, just like Venice, it felt like we were stepping into a painting.</p>\n<p>Grindelwald sits 1,034m above sea level in the Bernese Alps, nestled between the imposing Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau mountains. Officially it was still the summer season so there was no snow on the ground - we would have to climb much higher for that.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fc6a55ddd0.jpg\" alt=\"Grindelwald\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-19.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I couldn’t wait to get amongst it and breathe the fresh alpine air. Looking at Rachelle however, I feared she wasn’t in a fit state to join me yodelling amongst the mountains. She had started to feel like she was coming down with something while we were in Venice, and by the time we reached Grindelwald she was in full blown cough-her-guts-up mode. She toughed it out while we were in Grindelwald but that would effectively be the end of her holiday.</p>\n<p>We stayed at the <a href=\"http://www.hotel-gletschergarten.ch/\">Hotel Gletscergarten</a>, a charming family run chalet-hotel that has been around for 113 years. Our room had a skylight so when you laid on the bed you could look straight up at the Eiger mountain. It was very quiet when we visited in October. I think I only saw one other guest the whole time we were there.</p>\n<p>The whole village was quiet. That evening after arriving we tried out one of the restaurants and we were the only ones in there. After the meal we went back to the hotel and Lauren dragged us down to the games room. She was in her element - the whole games room to herself. We played table tennis for the first time in a very long time.</p>\n<p>We only had one full day in Grindelwald and there were a number of options for things to do that Thursday. One of them was a trip up to <a href=\"http://www.schilthorn.ch/en/schilthorn/\">Schilthorn</a> - a 32 min cable car ride up to the summit where a significant amount of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service was filmed. For a Bond fan like me, that was very tempting.</p>\n<p>As great as this sounded, all the guide books and travel sites told me that if you only have one day in Grindelwald a trip to Jungfraujoch should be top of the must-do list.</p>\n<h2>Jungfraujoch</h2>\n<p>Jungraujoch is called the ‘Top of Europe’ because at 3454 metres, it is Europe’s highest railway station, and the train journey to get there is described as one of the great train journeys of the world.</p>\n<p>We were warned to check the weather forecast early morning before we set off. If it was forecast bad weather over Jungfrau there would be no point going up as visibility would be zero. Thankfully, the forecast was good.</p>\n<p>We left early to beat the crowds to the top. At the station I handed over my life savings for 3 tickets. This must surely be the most expensive per-km railway journey anywhere in the world?</p>\n<p>We got on the train and was joined by two thousand Japanese tourists. Great. All trip it seemed like we were surrounded by snap-happy Japanese tourists. I hate to stereotype any nationality but Jesus they really need to have a word with themselves about camera etiquette. All trip we had been surrounded by them taking photographs of absolutely everything, and I mean absolutely everything. It never ceased to amaze me when I saw them go over to look at an amazing view or take a picture of a famous landmark, snap the picture and immediately walk away without actually looking at it without a lens. What’s the point in that? They might as well have stayed at home and looked at photo’s on the Internet. A lot of them were also using their iPad to take pictures. Apart from the fact that they look stupid holding an iPad up to their face to take photo’s, the iPad is a crap camera. The iPhone on the other hand is an excellent camera. We even saw one Japanese woman on her own on a kids ride in Singapore filming herself for the full duration of the ride. Bizarre.</p>\n<p>Half of them don’t even know how to use a camera, like leaving their flash on for every night shot even if they’re taking a photo of a building 300 feet away - as if their tiny little flash is going to light up the entire city skyline. Rant over.</p>\n<p>The journey to the top took approx 50 minutes with two short stops on the way. The first stop was at Eigerwand (Eiger Wall). We stepped out onto the viewing platform and was greeted with spectacular views down into the valleys.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f1e526387a.jpg\" alt=\"Jungfrau valleys\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-22.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>At this point though we were still among the green mountains. It was the second stop at Eismeer (Sea of Ice) that blew me away. I stepped on to the viewing platform and it was as if we had stepped into another world. Gone was the greenery - replaced with snow and ice as far as the eye can see. It was truly breathtaking.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d7018cbe79.jpg\" alt=\"Sea of Ice\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-27.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The cogwheel rail carriage slowly took us up the tunnel that burrows through the Eiger and Monch mountains and into Jungfrau. The tunnel and railway station was completed in 1912. Within the complex there is a memorial to the many engineers that died during construction.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e29ff14039.jpg\" alt=\"Jungfraujoch memorial\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-36.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The highest railway station in Europe is unlike any I’d ever been to. On exiting the train you enter a series of tunnels that connect different features of the vast complex. After walking through the Ice Palace we went outside on to one of the peaks. There is an area that is cordoned off with ropes to stop you literally sliding off the mountain. Thank god for those ropes. Rach and Lauren took a few steps out before turning around and going back in. All around us tourists were falling on their backside - slipping on the ice. It would have been funny if I wasn’t concentrating so hard on keeping upright myself!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/00803cb4d7.jpg\" alt=\"Jungfraujoch peak\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-42.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>At that point the weather and visibility was good. I went to the edge of the peak gazed out at the Alps before me. It really was worth every one of the many Swiss Francs we paid to get to the top.</p>\n<p>After lunch we went to the Sphinx Observatory Tower which is at the summit of the Sphinx - a peak that lies just to the east of the col. By that point it had started snowing and Rach was in no state to go outside, so I went outside with Lauren. The Sphinx Observatory Tower offers 365 degree views but bad weather had suddenly descended on us and visibility was really poor. We couldn’t see a thing but Lauren loved it nonetheless. The last time she had experienced she was about 4 so really can’t remember it.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0ed029d8c7.jpg\" alt=\"Sphinx Observatory\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" title=\"Grindelwald-55.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Here’s a video I found on YouTube that provides an overview of Jungfraujoch:</p>\n<p>[youtube [www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkjV1mwQx6k])</p>\n<p>We returned to Grindelwald mid-afternoon. Rach went straight back to the hotel as by that time she really was coughing her guts up. I took Lauren for a game of crazy golf.</p>\n<p>That evening we had a quiet night relaxing in the hotel. We would be catching a train to Paris the next day so a little bit of relaxation was called for before another cram-it-in city visit.</p>\n<p>I loved our short time in Grindelwald and we were gutted to leave. We could have easily spent a week there.</p>\n",

The water bus would have been cheaper but at that time of night it was too late to mess about. I wasn’t even sure they still ran past midnight. Luckily we managed to share a water taxi with a Scottish couple. On our own it would have been over ¢100.</p>\n<p>We cruised down the Grand Canal towards our hotel. This is the way to arrive! It reminded me of that scene in Casino Royale towards the end when James Bond cruises down the Grand Canal in a luxury yacht, before (spoiler alert) Eva Green goes on to betray him. Well this wasn’t quite a luxury yacht and I hadn’t just finished convalescing at a luxury retreat after being tortured for my poker winnings, but that didn’t stop me considering the similarities.</p>\n<p>We got lost for the first of many times to come trying to find our hotel. In fact, we had walked past it and completely missed the sign. Luckily Rach was on the ball when we doubled back to look again. We were only there for two nights so had booked in to a cheap Guest house - the <a href=\"http://www.palazzorosa.com/en/\">Palazzo Rosa</a>.</p>\n<p>After far too little sleep we were up early that Tuesday morning to make the most of the day. We only had one full day in Venice so we were determined to make the most of it. Unlike other places on our trip I hadn’t booked tickets for any of the sights in Venice. I had already determined from the guide books that there was enough to see just walking around Venice in a day, without trying to fit in tours of St Mark’s Basilica, Doge’s Palace or the other major sites that would undoubtedly require spending a good amount of time waiting in queues. We would have to save them for a future trip.</p>\n<p>Venice is a magnificent walking city. We walked and walked and walked that day and loved every minute of it. Even Lauren enjoyed it. Well, she didn’t complain about the walking which was a rare treat. Walking the streets of Venice is like stepping into a renaissance-era painting.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1557972623.jpg\" alt=\"Venice grand canal 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Everywhere you look there’s a feast for the eyes; the pastel colours of the buildings, the ornate fórcolas on the gondolas, the hidden gardens, the carnival masks and Morano glass displayed in the boutique shop windows.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8be0abfb8a.jpg\" alt=\"Venetian Masks\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/209b013050.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Gondola\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>It’s a magical city and in my opinion we chose the perfect time to visit. It was busy but not over-crowded as I’m told it is in the heights of summer. The sun was out and it was warm - not too warm or too cold, the perfect temperature for walking. There were a few puddles about hinting at earlier rain but there wasn’t a drop of rain while we were there. It was bliss.</p>\n<p>Some people had described Venice to me as dirty and smelly. I didn’t find that at all. All I could smell was the fresh salty sea air.</p>\n<p>We walked from our hotel towards St Mark’s Square (Piazza San Marco), passing over the Rialto Bridge. The narrow streets and small squares were bustling with tourists but, again, it wasn’t over-crowded.</p>\n<p>Italy is renowned for its Piazzas and surely San Marco must be its finest. Dominated at one end by the byzantine-style domes of St Mark’s Basilica and the towering Campanile, and surrounded by a mixture of renaissance, baroque, and neo-classical buildings on each side that once held the offices that governed the vast Venetian empire that stretched all the way to Turkey.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a9ae4ab716.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Campanile\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We took a seat at one of the pavement cafe’s with a live orchestra, knowing that I was probably about to drink the most expensive coffee I’d ever purchased. I didn’t mind. If you’re going to over-pay for a coffee where better than a beautiful morning in St Mark’s while being serenaded by a live classical orchestra. Only after sitting down did I realise that we were sat at Caffè Florian - one of the first places in Europe to serve coffee (Circa 1720).</p>\n<p>That morning San Marco was alive with tourists marvelling at their surroundings, and parents watching their kids chase the pigeons, as I’m sure it is every morning.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f588e0e906.jpg\" alt=\"Venice St Mark's Square\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On leaving St Mark’s we briefly considered getting tickets for a tour of either St Mark’s Basilica, Doge’s Palace, or the Campanile, but that quickly left our heads after we saw the queues. If we had been in Venice for longer I would have bought tickets in advance.</p>\n<p>The rest of the morning and afternoon was spent wandering the city, getting lost and loving it. Every now and again we would spot a sign-post pointing to San Marco or Rialto, which would help us re-gain our bearings. If all else failed we could always refer to the life-saver which is Google Maps on my iPhone.</p>\n<p>We briefly joined the tourists jostling for a spot to take a photo of the Bridge of Sighs, so called, according to legend, because when the prisoners passed through the bridge from Doge's Palace on the left to the prison the right, they took one final look at glorious Venice and sighed, before entering the dark, dank prison. It was called the Prisons' Bridge before Lord Byron renamed it in the 19th Century.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2916505e39.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Bridge of Sighs\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>For lunch we found a small Trattoria and went for some traditional Italian pizza. Sat outside eating our lunch we had to laugh when a group of Japanese tourists came up and asked the waiter if they could get their photo taken in front of the restaurant holding one of the pizza boxes.</p>\n<p>We returned to our hotel mid-afternoon to get changed for the evening. We wanted to head out for the evening while it was still light so that we could take a sunset ride on a gondola.</p>\n<p>If Venice looks great mid-day, it looks absolutely stunning during the soft light of sunset - a great time to take a Gondola ride. It’s expensive but you can’t go to Venice and not take a Gondola ride. Rach and I sat in the customary couples position while Lauren had her own special chair back towards the gondolier. Most of the other gondolas had honeymooners so it may have looked a little odd with the three passengers but we weren’t bothered, if anything it was even more special having Lauren with us.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/047f0cb435.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Sunset\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/07d2c1d671.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Rialto Bridge\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Some of the Gondoliers serenade their customers singing songs from the opera through the canals of Venice. I’m glad to say ours limited it to the occasional history lesson of the buildings we were passing. Once we were out of the Grand Canal it was wonderfully relaxing drifting through the small canals with only the sound of the water lapping the sides.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/35a2e14fc7.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Canal\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>That evening we went for Dinner at a restaurant next to the Grand Canal near the Rialto bridge. For once I hadn’t done any research on restaurants or booked ahead so it was chosen purely at random. Once seated I did as the Venetians do and ordered a pre-dinner Spritz. Rach had a Bellini. The meal was pretty average but we had no complaints about the location.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b5c0c3f305.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Gondolas\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Later, we wandered back to the hotel passing some mouth-watering Gelato, wishing that we had skipped dessert.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/232f564ef6.jpg\" alt=\"Venice gelato\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The next morning we had to be up bright and early to get to the train station for our 07:50 train onwards to our next destination.</p>\n<p>Venice is one of the most beautiful and unique places I’ve ever visited. One day wasn’t nearly enough. We will return!</p>\n",

The full clan was there to greet us and it was lovely to see them all again and meet the new arrivals. Rach was in her element finally getting to cuddle her new nephew and niece. The beers were cracked open and we stayed up gabbing long past midnight.</p>\n<h2>Doncaster</h2>\n<p>On Saturday morning we went to <a href=\"http://www.robinhoodairport.com/\">Robin Hood airport</a> to pick up an hire car we had booked. I still find it a bit weird calling it Robin Hood airport. It’s not even in Nottinghamshire. Maybe the very end of the runway just goes over the border into Nottinghamshire but that’s a pretty tenuous connection. It was formerly RAF Finningley and with one of the longest runways in the UK it was used during the Cold War to launch nuclear-armed Vulcan bombers. That runway doesn’t look to be getting much action these days.</p>\n<p>I’m sure when they turned Finningley into a commercial airport in 2005 they had thoughts of it becoming a major international hub. After all, the runway is long enough to land an A380. When we arrived that Saturday morning it was like a ghost town.</p>\n<p>We walked into the terminal to the hire-car desk and we must have been the only people in there that weren’t staff. The woman on the Hertz desk looked pleased to see us, I think we were the only reservation she had that day! She told us that the barman at the airport bar across from the rental desks is usually falling asleep in the afternoon. They were only doing two passenger flights a day.</p>\n<p>I had booked a Honda Accord or similar, however, the car we had reserved had developed an engine fault so they offered us a Nissan Qashqai instead. A Nissan what? I’d never heard of it. I don’t think they sell them in Australia. We had to pay a bit extra as it was an upgrade but I had no complaints when I got in it - a lovely ride with all the gadgets. It came as a bit of a surprise the following day when I had to put it into reverse for the first time and a reversing camera appeared where the large built-in SatNav display is. It made a bit of a difference to my usual ride - our shitty old Toyota Corolla. Our shit-heap was only supposed to be a temporary run-around when we arrived in Australia before we invested in a better one. 5 years later and we’ve still got the shit-heap after realising that a car isn’t an investment. You invest in assets. Assets aren’t supposed to lose value from the day you buy them. Anyone who lists their car as an asset and not a liability is kidding themselves.</p>\n<p>As lovely as the Nissan Qashqai was to drive, it did share one thing in common with our Toyota Corolla - a lack of power. It really struggled up hills. Only a pretend 4x4 then.</p>\n<p>After picking up the hire-car we went for a drive around Doncaster to check out some of our old haunts. We drove past our old house in Cantley, disgusted by what the new residents had done with the place - building a fake, plastic porch on the front that looked completely out of place with the style of the house.</p>\n<p>We also went to Asda to pick up a few bits. Oh how we miss Asda. Australia is dominated by the supermarket duopoly of Coles and Woolworths and this lack of competition means supermarkets in Australia have no where near the range or quality of goods that you get in UK supermarkets.</p>\n<p>We quickly made our way to the booze aisles and were gobsmacked to find our favourite Australian wines cheaper in Asda (1600km away) than back home. Ludicrous!</p>\n<p>The rest of the weekend was spent visiting family and friends in what was one very busy, non-stop weekend.</p>\n<p>It’s surprising how much you forget in 5 years. The first time I drove to Worksop from Doncaster that weekend I had to put the Satnav on. It was ridiculous. I used to drive that route every weekend but now I was completely confused. It wasn’t as if the roads had changed. I just couldn’t remember the route. Luckily, after driving it once it all came flooding back and I was driving around Doncaster and Worksop like I’d never left. For a while though it felt like I was on Mars.</p>\n<p>Monday morning came and we packed our bags once more to head down south for three days of more sight-seeing. This time though we were travelling in force - both sets of parents were joining us for the trip.</p>\n<h2>The Cotswolds</h2>\n<p>It’s amazing how many places in the UK we had never visited. Places which we would have considered at the time to be too far away for a day-trip. Living in Australia has changed our perspective on distance. You can fit the size of the UK into just Queensland 7 times, and crossing the country from Brisbane to Perth is like flying from London to Baghdad (in distance that is, I’m not comparing Perth to Baghdad!).</p>\n<p>One of these places that I’d never visited before was the Cotswolds. Or maybe I had. I’m pretty sure that when I was young the Cotswolds were not a well known tourist attraction as they are today; more some pretty villages that you could stop off at on the way down to Devon or Cornwall.</p>\n<p>The Cotswolds covers a 25 by 90 mile chunk of Gloucestershire and is famous for its historic town and villages which, in medieval Britain, kick-started the wool trade.</p>\n<p>Our first stop would be <a href=\"http://www.chippingcampden.co.uk/\">Chipping Campden</a>. This market town was once the home to the richest wool merchants and is known for its beautiful thatched cottages and high street. Typically, as we made our way south that morning the heavens opened up and it started chucking it down. Really chucking it down. As we entered rural Gloucestershire there were signs that the roads were starting to flood and it wasn’t long before we were having to ease the car through huge puddles that had formed where the roads cut through the valleys. We had come prepared so out came the waterproof jackets as soon as we got to Chipping Campden.</p>\n<p>We arrived close to lunch time so we headed for the nearby <a href=\"http://www.eightbellsinn.co.uk/\">Eight Bells pub</a>, a charming 14th Century inn. Was it too early to have a pint? No I don’t think so, I was on holiday!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f6e9b389cf.jpg\" alt=\"Eight Bells Pub\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>After lunch the rain had eased off slightly so we went for a walk through this pretty little town. In the centre of the High St stands Chipping Campden’s most famous monument - the Market Hall. Built in 1627 by Sir Baptist Hicks, it may now be an empty shell but in its day it was a thriving centre of trade for the region. Merchants from as far away as Venice would travel here to barter for the finest wool in Europe, the guide books tell us. Looking up at the roof of the Market Hall from beneath you can see that the Cotswold stone roof is still held to together by wooden pegs, and the timber roof supports are true to the original.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/857d4f77b0.jpg\" alt=\"Chipping Campden Market Hall\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Adjacent to the market hall is a World War 1 monument, reminding us of the high price Chipping Campden and other small towns such as this paid during the Great War.</p>\n<p>I could see why tourist flock to this area. This and the other towns and villages that constitute the Cotswolds retain an idealistic view of old England. The town’s street plan and property lines remain as they were in the 12th century and the High St remains, architecturally, as it was in the 1840’s - all the houses made of the same Cotswolds stone. Thankfully for us visitors, planning law ensure it stays that way.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/198e934531.jpg\" alt=\"Chipping Campden Church\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We left Chipping Campden and took a short drive through picturesque countryside to <a href=\"http://www.bourtoninfo.com/\">Bourton-on-the-Water</a>, known as the ‘Venice of the Cotswolds’. I’m not sure the likeness is entirely deserved after visiting Venice later in our trip. Nevertheless, I could see why hordes of tourists flock there in the summer. Even on this damp, miserable day, you could still appreciate the quaintness. The weather meant that this small town was relatively quiet for our visit. I enjoyed the tranquility as we walked along the canal - I’m sure it would be anything but tranquil in the heights of summer.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/849eaf1466.jpg\" alt=\"Bourton-on-the-Water\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2a3f2c0509.jpg\" alt=\"Bourton-on-the-Water High St\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>After the obligatory traditional Afternoon Tea we left Bourton-on-the-Water and headed south-west to the B&B I had booked us for the night on the way to Bath - the <a href=\"http://www.barbersbridge.co.uk/\">Dark Barn Lodge</a> near Gloucester. A good evening meal, drinks and a comfortable bed helped us refresh for the following day.</p>\n<h2>Bath</h2>\n<p>We were up bright and early the Tuesday morning for a full English breakfast before driving to Bath, another major tourist destination in the UK that I had somehow never made it to in the 32 years that I lived in the UK.</p>\n<p>I had hopes that Bath would be like York, one of our favourite cities in England, and I wasn’t disappointed. Much like York - Bath has some of the most well-preserved roman remains in the UK. It also has some of the finest Georgian architecture.</p>\n<p>We arrived in Bath and headed straight for the <a href=\"http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/default.aspx\">Roman Baths</a>. We took a self-guided tour using the audio guides provided. One of the things I liked about the tour was that, as well as having the usual historian narrating the guide, there’s also a choice to listen to Bill Bryson give his own take on the exhibits and artefacts on the tour. If you’re a fan of Bill Bryson like I am you’ll enjoy his alternative commentary which is a little less dry than the standard audio guides.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/11318b96ed.jpg\" alt=\"Bath\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>When I was a kid the Romans were covered extensively in the school curriculum. It’s amazing how much came back to me as I viewed the excavated baths and exhibits explaining how the Romans changed and civilised Britain.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/120c36956c.jpg\" alt=\"Roman\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>After the tour we thought about having lunch at the adjacent <a href=\"http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/food_and_drink/pump_room_restaurant.aspx\">Pump Room restaurant</a>, but as soon as we walked in and saw the queue we thought again. Reservations are recommended! Instead, we went to a local pub for lunch.</p>\n<p>After lunch, we made the short walk to the Circus and the Royal Crescent - both magnificent examples of Georgian architecture. The Circus, true to its name, is a circular arrangement of houses, all pretty much identical from the front - like the Rome Coliseum turned inside out. Quite fitting when you remember that Bath, with its seven hills, aspired to be the ‘Rome of England’.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3cb055135a.jpg\" alt=\"The Circus\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The ground-floor entrances were made wide enough for the aristocrats to be carried straight through in their sedan chairs, and tall enough so that the ladies could enter without disturbing their towering hairdos. On the top-floor you can see the tiny round windows which would have been the servant's quarters.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/19b1fc9d56.jpg\" alt=\"The Circus Top Floor\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>I stood in the centre of the Circus, amongst the grand plane trees, and admired the 360 degree panorama around me. I’d read that if you clap, it echoes three times around the Circus. I tried it, and it did, kind of. I must have started a trend because all of a sudden groups of tourists around me tried the same.</p>\n<p>The Royal Crescent is only a block away from the Circus. As we arrived, however, the heavens opened, so we quickly retreated to a nearby cafe.</p>\n<p>Mid-afternoon we checked in to our hotel. I had booked us all into the Hilton, making use of some of my air-miles. Rach did her lady of leisure thing and soaked in the bath with a glass of wine. A spur of the moment decision earlier that day had led me to book a table at Jamie Oliver’s Italian for us all that evening. It was a good decision. That evening we convened at the Hilton bar for a few cocktails before crossing over the road to Jamie’s Italian for another fantastic meal. Food, service, all impeccable, and it wasn’t that expensive. I believe there’s a few Jamie’s Italians around the UK and they’re priced below what you’d expect for a celebrity Chef restaurant. Rach was happy as the staff let her take home a few Jamie’s Italian hand towels.</p>\n<h2>Longleat House and Safari Park</h2>\n<p>Wednesday morning we were up bright and early to check out of the hotel and make the short journey to <a href=\"http://www.longleat.co.uk/\">Longleat House and Safari Park</a>. This had been on Rachelle’s to-do list for a long time and was one of the first visits she requested when we booked the holiday.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/42026fbb45.jpg\" alt=\"Longleat House\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We started with a guided tour of the house. Wherever you are in the UK you’re never far from a historic house that has been turned into a museum. Longleat House is probably one of the better one, and while it is open to the public for much of the year, it’s still a living, breathing home to Lord Bath and his family.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/70fa9cc841.jpg\" alt=\"Longleat House Dining\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The ground floor to the house is much like any other mansion of the period. Think Downton Abbey. It’s the upstairs apartments that remind you that house isn’t owned by any old Lord of the Manor. If you look up the word ‘quirky’ in the dictionary you may see a picture of Lord Bath next to it. We could only get a small glimpse of his private apartments but from what we saw they could be described as quirky - on steroids!</p>\n<p>After the tour we hopped back in the car for the drive around the Safari Park. Lauren got in my Mum and Dad’s car as we thought it wouldn’t be a good idea to take the hire car through the monkey enclosure.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b543a83e8c.jpg\" alt=\"Safari Park Monkey Enclosure\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The Safari Park is a fair size, as it should be, and most of the animals come right up to the car. Whilst I’m sure it’s not the same as an adventure through the Masai Mara, for a fraction of the price of an African safari Longleat in Wiltshire aint that bad.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8e3f8a24b3.jpg\" alt=\"Safari Park 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>After the ride through the park we went for another self-guided walk through the house before hopping on a the ‘Jungle Cruise’, which sails past some Gorillas, and a shy Hippo (which I couldn’t spot). The cruise gave Lauren a chance to feed the seals.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c41ce18831.jpg\" alt=\"Safari Park 3\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0040ea11d7.jpg\" alt=\"Safari Park 4\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Besides the House and Safari Park there’s a fair few attractions at Longleat that we would have made the most of, if only the weather was a little better. But that’s Britain for you. Nonetheless, you could easily enjoy 2 days at Longleat.</p>\n<p>That was the end of our mini-break and we headed back up north, with a quick detour past Stonehenge.</p>\n<p>Thursday through to Friday is a long blur of more family and friend visits in Worksop and Doncaster, and far too much alcohol.</p>\n<h2>Worksop</h2>\n<p>On the Friday night, I had made plans to go out on the town with my life-long friend Mark to celebrate his birthday. Unfortunately, that town was Worksop. I can’t blame him, it was my idea. For some reason after a long time away I had some crazy sentimental yearning to re-visit the nightlife of my youth. As it turned out, the nightlife of my youth had long since retired to a rehab clinic.</p>\n<p>I’d been warned that the nightlife had changed since the introduction of 24-hr pub licences, and particularly with the effects of the recession, but this was ridiculous. The pubs were empty, even after midnight. Midnight, I was told, was the new 8pm. It was more like 11am on a Monday morning.</p>\n<p>It was pretty sad really. Each pub was the same - perhaps twenty customers at the most. The dance floors empty with the exception of a couple of The Only Way is Essex wannabes dancing around their handbags. What has happened to English women in the last 5 years? Fake tans, fake nails, hair extensions, dresses too small for their kebab-infested bodies. It was like a Victorian freak show.</p>\n<p>I swapped horror stories by text with Rach who had the wiser decision to go out in Doncaster with her friend Paula. Mind you, by the sound of it Doncaster wasn’t that much better.</p>\n<p>I’ve now been told that nobody goes out any more on a Friday night. Saturday night is much busier. Lightweights! When I was a lad Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights were all heaving.</p>\n<p>The experience did remind me why I stopped going out in Worksop a long time before we emigrated. When I did go out it would more likely be to the big smoke - Sheffield. I was so adventurous!</p>\n<p>On the Saturday morning I woke up on the sofa at my parent’s house by Mum with a cup of tea and some breakfast. How comes wives never have as much sympathy for a hangover as Mums? After briefly contemplating ditching the wife, child and life in Australia, and moving back in with my Mum and Dad, I remembered I had a wedding to attend.</p>\n<p>I drove back over to Doncaster to rejoin Rach and Lauren for the wedding of her 2nd cousin, John. It was a great day. The service took place in a beautiful little church in Armthorpe, followed by a reception lunch and evening party at the <a href=\"http://www.theearl.co.uk/\">Earl of Doncaster Hotel</a>, known for its exquisite art-deco interior design.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4c0f1631b9.jpg\" alt=\"Earl of Doncaster Hotel\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The Sunday was our final day with family. It culminated with a farewell dinner at the <a href=\"http://www.vintageinn.co.uk/thehareandtortoisedoncaster/\">Hare and Tortoise pub</a> - a favourite of ours when we lived in Doncaster. Both sets of parents, brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces were there to say goodbye, with plenty a tear shed.</p>\n<h2>Harry Potter</h2>\n<p>We left Doncaster early Monday morning for our final UK visit before catching a flight from Gatwick Airport to our next destination.</p>\n<p>We had tickets for the new <a href=\"http://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/\">Harry Potter Movie Studios Tour</a> at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesdon.</p>\n<p>Lauren is a Harry Potter nut, being at that age where she has grown up with the franchise. It’s fair to say she was a little excited about this little stop-off!</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3b168e5437.jpg\" alt=\"Weasley House\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The tour was pretty impressive, but not yet great. I’m sure over time it will grow into a wonderful experience but for me it seemed to be missing something. Die hard fans will love it, I’m sure. Perhaps I was too annoyed by the snap-happy camera-wielding idiots who kept getting in my way every time I tried to read something. That’s the problem with everyone having a camera-phone in their pockets these days - they feel the need to take a photo of every single inanimate object. I might be being a bit hypocritical but at least I try and limit my photo taking to pics that tell the story of my trip. Not just any old shite.</p>\n<p>There were some impressive features along the tour, including the Great Hall, Diagon Alley, and a huge replica model of Hogwarts castle that is quite breathtaking, both in its size and detail.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2747d72900.jpg\" alt=\"Hogwarts\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Lauren loved it, that’s the most important thing. The tour had the obligatory exit through the gift shop, where Lauren could have spent all day, I’m sure.</p>\n<p>So that was it. The UK portion of our trip was over and we were just over halfway through our trip in total. The days were passing by far too quickly.</p>\n",

We arrived at Heathrow just after 5am on the Tuesday morning and was met by my parents at Arrivals. It was great to see them again. It had been 2 years since we last saw them - when they came over for our wedding.</p>\n<p>On our way out of Arrivals I spotted some vending machines selling PAYG SIM cards so I picked up a couple up for Rach and I. We had both made sure our phones were unlocked before travelling. Having Internet access would be very handy in London. I’d already loaded up my iPhone with London-specific apps. The only problem is, as we discovered, it’s a bit of a pain for visitors to top-up the phones. We had o2 accounts and when we tried to top-up online it wouldn’t let us because they don’t accept credit cards registered to an overseas address. How stupid is that? I rang them and they confirmed that our only option would be to top-up at one of the shops. This was ok in London but it meant we couldn’t use the same SIM when travelling around the rest of Europe, or at least we could only use it until our credit ran out. It was handy having the SIM in London but even if you don’t buy a SIM you could probably get away with wifi. The city seems to be blanketed with free wifi hotspots.</p>\n<p>I was surprised to find when we got to Venice that the overseas data charges for the 02 SIM was only £1.99 per day. That’s in stark contrast to the Australian telcos who charge a fortune for overseas roaming. Incidentally, we had also purchased TravelSIMs from Australia Post before we left, which work in any country. My advice is if you want the SIM primarily for data, forget it. The TravelSIM is fairly reasonable for phone calls but for data it’s a rip-off, if you even manage to get it to work that is.</p>\n<p>I digress. We had booked into the <a href=\"http://www.princessquarehotel.co.uk/\">Princess Square Hotel </a>near Bayswater - a cheap B&B. It’s in a great area, a couple of blocks away from Hyde Park and close to both the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations. It’s cheap but you get what you pay for. There wasn’t enough room to swing a cat in our room. It’s pretty standard in London for the rooms to be small but that one took the biscuit. Oh well, we had no intention of spending much time in the hotel. At least the beds were comfortable.</p>\n<p>Accepting that I wouldn’t be able to sleep on the flight I had paid for the night before so that we could get our heads down for a few hours as soon as we arrived. That was the plan. As it happened we were wide awake, eager to get amongst it. I say ‘we’, Lauren was straight off - snoring her head off. We let her have a couple of hours and then headed out.</p>\n<h2>London Day 1</h2>\n<p>We didn’t have much of an itinerary for the first day. We figured we’d pick up tickets for the <a href=\"http://www.bigbustours.com/eng/london/custompage.aspx?id=london_sightseeing_tour&gclid=\">Big Bus</a> open-deck bus tour and start the circuit. This was Lauren’s first trip to London (that she could remember) so the hop-on hop-off bus tour is a good way to get an orientation of the city. With the Big Bus ticket you also get a river cruise on the Thames included.</p>\n<p>That would be later. First we caught the tube to Oxford St, had a walk down Oxford St towards Piccadilly Circus, stopping for lunch on the way.</p>\n<p>There were a number of things that we were looking forward to with this being our first trip back to the UK in 5 years, and one of those was to have a proper pub-lunch. This may seem insignificant but it’s surprising how much you miss the little things. The pubs in Australia are very different. They’re good too in their own way but there’s something very cozy and quaint about a traditional English pub serving proper Ale and pub-grub. Bliss!</p>\n<p>After lunch we continued our walk and came across one of the Big Bus tour outlets so picked up our tickets. The tickets last for 24 hours so if you purchase them in the afternoon you can use them until the same time the following day, which is what we did.</p>\n<p>We had planned to meet my parents at some point in the afternoon, we were just waiting for them to ring. We hopped on the bus and made it as far as Trafalgar Square when they rang us to say they were on their way. We told them we’d hop-off and meet them in Covent Garden.</p>\n<p>Covent Garden holds fond memories for me from my time in the Navy. I was stationed at what was then the St Vincent Maritime Communication Centre (ComCen) for a brief 6-months - underneath the old Foreign & Commonwealth Office building just off Trafalgar Square. If you go to Trafalgar Square then on to the Mall, there’s a long line of elegant buildings directly on the left after you go through Admiralty Arch. The ComCen was deep under there. I’m assuming the location isn’t covered by the Official Secrets Act (oops). It’s quite hard to find. I remember the first day I started. I had the address but couldn’t find the entrance. I even asked for directions from some policemen who were in the area and they didn’t have a clue where it was either. I had to ring the ComCen and get someone to come out and show me the entrance. It turned out to be quite an amazing place. During the long night shifts we would often go and explore the underground tunnels, built during World War II to connect Whitehall to the Houses of Parliament.</p>\n<p>Covent Garden is only a short walk from Trafalgar Square so when we finished the day shifts it would often be the start for a pub crawl. If it was good weather we’d also occasionally head down to one of the floating pub moored up on the Thames in Westminster.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/160aca2cd1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/160aca2cd1.jpg\" alt=\"Covent Garden\" title=\"Covent-garden-1\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1006\" /></a></p>\n<p>Again, I digress. We walked to Covent Garden with a quick detour past the Lamb and Flag pub - a favourite watering hole of Charles Dickens.</p>\n<p>Covent Garden wasn’t much different to how I remembered it. Steet artists plying their trade and pavement cafes serving over-priced drink.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d7270145f1.jpg\" alt=\"Covent Garden Charlie Chaplin\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We had a walk around the markets and paused for a while to watch a violin quintet entertaining the diners tucking into their Paella.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ee0a66585b.jpg\" alt=\"Giant Paella\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5af801bd13.jpg\" alt=\"Covent Garden violin quintet\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:10px;\" /></p>\n<p>While waiting for my parents to arrive we had a quick wander into the Covent Garden Apple Store - well you have to don’t you! Apple Stores are tourist attractions in their own right - each one an <a href=\"http://www.huftonandcrow.com/projects/gallery/apple-store-covent-garden/\">architectural work of art</a>.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dd673b79a8.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Store staircase\" style=\"float:left;margin:10px;\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d3f3c511b2.jpg\" alt=\"Covent Garden Apple Store\" style=\"float:left;margin:10px;\" /></p>\n<p>Once my parents arrived we had afternoon tea in Covent Garden and then spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in the West End. From Covent Garden we walked through Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, Chinatown and on to Regent St and Oxford St to do a bit of shopping, including a stop at Hamleys, the famous toy store, for Lauren.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/269589b659.jpg\" alt=\"Piccadilly Circus\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>I was determined to travel light for the trip. I did - too light. Hand-washing underwear in your hotel room is all well and good if you can then get them to dry. Sorry Rick Steves, I let you down, but in my defence travelling as light as I had started out was always going to be a problem with an itinerary like ours, which involved heat and 100% humidity, followed by a UK Autumn and then 0 degrees in the Swiss Alps. Layers, I know.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9b7cd35180.jpg\" alt=\"H&M London\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On the way back to our hotel we stopped for dinner at a Bella Italia restaurant on Queensway, which was so-so.</p>\n<h2>London Day 2</h2>\n<p>On day–2 (Wednesday) in London we picked up the Big Bus tour again near our hotel and stayed on it all the way around to the Tower of London. We passed too many sights to recount, again, a reminder that you could spend a year in London and not see everything.</p>\n<p>Once we got to the Tower we headed for a Costa Coffee and waited for my parents. Costa Coffee seems to have taken over the UK since I left, they’re everywhere. I used to like Costa Coffees and Starbucks before I came to Australia. I now know there’s a lot better coffee in the world. Australia has become renowned for its great cafes and baristas in the last few years, particularly Melbourne.</p>\n<p>We didn’t go in the Tower of London - that was planned for Friday. When my parents arrived we all took a cruise with <a href=\"http://www.citycruises.com/\">City Cruises</a> down to Westminster. That stretch of the river has some great sights including <a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/hms-belfast\">HMS Belfast</a> - a Town-class Cruiser that was one of the largest and most powerful British Cruisers during World War II. My uncle served on her during the late 50s. It’s now a museum administered by the Imperial War Museum. The trip down the river was made even more enjoyable by the pilot who looked like Captain Birdseye and whose commentary had us in stitches.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dc2f63124d.jpg\" alt=\"HMS Belfast\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On arrival at Westminster Pier we walked over Westminster Bridge and down the South Bank promenade past the London Eye.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/be25447b31.jpg\" alt=\"London Eye\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We stopped off for lunch at Wagamama and then had a look around <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern\">Tate Modern</a>. The major art galleries and museums in London are now subsidised by the government - meaning free entry. I’ve been to Tate Britain before but this was my first time in Tate Modern.</p>\n<p>Outside Tate Modern there was a local school group reciting a passage from Shakespeare's The Temptest.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2992258e78.jpg\" alt=\"South Bank London\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>I have mixed feelings about modern art. Some of it is extraordinary and interesting. Some of it is pretentious nonsense.</p>\n<p>After the Tate Modern we walked across the Millennium Bridge (or the <a href=\"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Millennium_Bridge\">Death Eater Bridge</a> as it’s known to Lauren), designed by <a href=\"http://www.fosterandpartners.com/\">Sir Norman Foster</a>, to St Paul’s Cathedral. Unfortunately we didn’t have time to tour St Paul’s Cathedral as we had dinner plans.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/82bddee127.jpg\" alt=\"Millennium Bridge\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>That evening we went to <a href=\"http://www.searcyschampagnebars.co.uk/onenewchange-home.php\">Searcy’s Champagne Bar</a> for cocktails before having dinner at Jamie Oliver’s <a href=\"http://www.barbecoa.com/\">Barbecoa</a>. The meal was superb - possibly the best we had on the trip.</p>\n<h2>London Day 3</h2>\n<p>The third day in London, Thursday, was mad. This was the one day when there was no flexibility, I had pre-booked everything.</p>\n<p>It started with a tour of Buckingham Palace - one of the highlights of our trip. This was the first time we’d been inside. Talk about bling, I thought the Vatican was opulent. We took the audio tour through the State Rooms, which for this year only included the Jubilee Diamonds display. This was followed by a walk through the gardens.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e227c6e3d6.jpg\" alt=\"Buckingham Palace Gardens\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On completion of the tour we made it out just in time to catch the arse-end of the Changing of the Guards.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f4a86d4f81.jpg\" alt=\"Buckingham Palace 1\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>We then headed along Birdcage Walk to Parliament Square. Rach and I had tickets for a tour of the Houses of Parliament while the grandparents took Lauren for some lunch. We spent a few minutes in Parliament Square before the tour, taking in our surroundings and admiring the statues of Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln.</p>\n<p>Parliament Square is a great starting-point for a tour of Westminster - between Westminster Bridge and Trafalgar Square. It starts with the statue of Boudicea riding her two-horse chariot - the Celtic warrior who refused to be Romanised. After Julius Caesar invaded and established Londinium, she lead a briefly successful revolt in A.D 60 after Roman soldiers raped her daughter. The revolt she led resulted in the slaughter of 60,000 Roman soldiers, but they were eventually overcome. Boudicea and her family took poison to avoid surrender.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bcb51f8227.jpg\" alt=\"Boudicea\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Looking across from Parliament you have St Margaret’s Church, often confused with Westminster Abbey by tourists. Westminster Abbey sits behind it. Whereas Westminster Abbey is the site for coronations and royal weddings, since 1480 St Margaret’s Church has been the place for politician’s weddings, including Winston Churchill’s marriage to Clementine.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the corner where Parliament Square meets Whitehall was the site for the world’s first traffic light in 1868. More recently, Parliament Square, along with Trafalgar Square, has been the focal point for many protests over the years, particularly in the last decade with the protests against the Iraq War.</p>\n<p>The HoP are only open at certain times of the year, when parliament is in recess. Luckily for us, the parliament was in recess for the party conference season.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38627de0cc.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The tour was fascinating. Commencing in the 900 yr old <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/westminsterhall/\">Westminster Hall</a>and then following the path the Queen takes during the State Opening of Parliament - from the grandeur of the House of Lords through to the relative slum that is the House of Commons. While we were in the HoP we spotted <a href=\"http://www.tanni.co.uk/\">Tanni Grey-Thompson</a>, now a member of the House of Lords. We also spotted <a href=\"http://www.mikeweatherleymp.com/2012/09/21/yngwie-malmsteen-visits-parliament-to-join-mikes-rock-the-house/\">Yngwie Malmsteen</a> (Swedish rock guitarist) being given a personal tour by a MP. I’ll be honest, I had to look Yngwie up as I’d never heard of him.</p>\n<p>After the tour we walked up Whitehall to Trafalgar Square. I love walking Whitehall, there is so much to see and consider. You have the great ministries of state, including the Ministry of Defence and Treasury. There’s Downing St on the left of course, although these days there’s not much to see. You can’t even see the famous door of 10 Downing St from the iron gates. The last time Rach and I stood outside the gates we were interviewed by an American news crew. We were walking past Downing St and spotted a commotion with lots of TV cameras, so stopped to see what all the fuss was about. The next minute we had a microphone stuffed in our face asking what we thought of the news of the birth of the Prime Minster’s (Tony Blair) latest child. What can you say to that? I wanted to say ‘who cares’ but I’m sad to admit I was much more diplomatic. I’ve no idea if it was broadcast.</p>\n<p>In the middle of Whitehall you have the Cenotaph. I once took part in November Ceremonies as it’s called in the Navy - part of the Armed Forces guard that accompanies the Queen and other dignitaries who lay their wreaths during the 11th November ceremony to commemorate Armistice Day, also known as Remembrance Sunday. I was press-ganged into it due to an incident I had in Antwerp, Belgium a few months earlier. I’ll save that story for another time.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ee3bf9a86e.jpg\" alt=\"Cenotaph\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>Further up Whitehall you have Banqueting House on the right. A few years ago, shortly after leaving the Navy, I attended an IT vendor event at Banqueting House, without knowing the history of the place in which I was standing.</p>\n<p>Banqueting House is what’s left of Whitehall Palace - once the largest palace in Europe. Originally built for King Henry VIII and further extended over the years for other monarchs, including Elizabeth 1, Whitehall Palace once stretched from Trafalgar Square to the Houses of Parliament (Westminster Palace as it was then known).</p>\n<p>Today, you can stand facing Banqueting House and look up at the 1st floor windows to the site where, in 1649, King Charles 1 stepped out on to a wooden platform, uttered his final word “Remember”, before having his head chopped off at the orders of Oliver Cromwell. The history books tell us that the anti-monarchist Oliver Cromwell went on to become just as dictatorial and corrupted by wealth as the monarchs before him. A few years later he would succumb to infection and was buried at Westminster Abbey. Then ironically 12 years to the day after the execution of King Charles 1, Oliver Cromwell’s body was exhumed and posthumously executed - his severed head displayed on a pole outside Westminster Hall until 1685. There’s statues of both Charles 1 and Oliver Cromwell at either end of Whitehall.</p>\n<p>Before arriving at Trafalgar Square you also have Horse Guard Parade on the left, most recently the site for the London Olympics beach volleyball.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a4f4ac90aa.jpg\" alt=\"Horse Guards\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>At Trafalgar Square we met up my parents and Lauren. Trafalgar Square is, culturally and geographically, the centre of London. It’s a shame then that the authorities allow it to be spoiled by tacky crap. My photo’s of Trafalgar Squares are spoiled by the sighting of a <a href=\"http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/52237/be-open-sound-portal-an-acoustic-oasis-in-londons-trafalgar-square/#.UKhpSePZ8nE\">large black ‘sound portal’ </a> , put there for this year’s London Design Festival. Oh, and cranes. There seemed to be cranes everywhere. I found it really hard to get any photo’s of London that wasn’t spoilt by cranes protruding into my shots. How dare they carry out construction during my visit! Here's a shot that I took of the fourth plinth at Trafalgar Square that i like:</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c31cf5254d.jpg\" alt=\"Fourth Plinth Trafalgar Square\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>From Trafalgar Square we headed for our next appointment - afternoon tea at the National Portrait Gallery. It’s advertised as having views out over Trafalgar Square but in truth you can just about see the statue of Admiral Nelson on top of his column, you’re certainly not looking down at Trafalgar Square.</p>\n<p>You can’t come to London and not have Afternoon Tea! After stuffing ourselves with sandwiches and cake we took a brief tour of the highlights of the National Portrait Gallery. I particularly enjoyed the contemporary photographs.</p>\n<p>From there we walked back towards Covent Garden as we had tickets for The Lion King at the Lyceum Theatre. We were slightly early so went for a pint around the corner at the <a href=\"http://fancyapint.com/Pub/london/lyceum-tavern/611\">Lyceum Tavern</a>.</p>\n<p>A trip to London is not complete without taking in a West End show. When deciding on which show to see my first choice would have been Les Miserables. However, we have an 11yr old daughter and given that we would be spending much of our time in London dragging her round from one historic sight to the next, we figured we’d let her choose the show, as long as her grandparents were happy with the selection of course. She chose The Lion King.</p>\n<p>I’ve never seen the film of The Lion King so went into it with no clue of the story line. My only knowledge of The Lion King was Elton John belting out The Circle of Life. I had an open mind and gave it a go, but it wasn’t my cup of tea. It’s a spectacular production but within 30 mins of it starting, all the walking and fresh air got the better of me and I dropped off. Ok, the beer might have had something to do with it too. I still couldn’t tell you what the story is about. Everyone else enjoyed it though.</p>\n<p>Our original itinerary was for the grandparents to take Lauren home after the show while Rach and I hit the West End, possibly to a comedy club or Jazz club. That was wishful thinking. Maybe when we were in our twenties we could have handled it but after the show there was only one place we were heading - Bedfordshire. I think I was asleep before my head hit the pillow.</p>\n<h2>London Day 4</h2>\n<p>We had one final set of tickets to use for our last day in London before driving up north to see the in-laws in Doncaster. After popping to see my uncle in Ladbroke Grove (who my parents were staying with), and then having a very cheap (by Brisbane standards) but hearty breakfast at the nearby Sainsbury’s cafe, we took a bus and then tube back over to Tower Hill to pick up our tickets for a tour of the Tower.</p>\n<p>I’ve been inside the <a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/\">Tower of London</a> before, as had Rach, but it was many years ago and we knew this would be something that Lauren would enjoy. To be fair, she had shown an interest wherever we had visited. She showed a lot more interest and patience for history and art than I’m sure I did at her age. Even so, a guided tour by the Wardens (beefeaters) telling stories of the gruesome murders and executions that took place at the Tower is always good fun for the kiddies (and adults).</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/15501111fc.jpg\" alt=\"Tower of London\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>The tour was as entertaining as I remembered. After the tour we spent some time visiting the Crown Jewels, White Tower and the Royal Armouries exhibition.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/be36fb3082.jpg\" alt=\"Tower of London\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" /></p>\n<p>On completion of our visit to the Tower we headed back to pick up our cases so we could try and get a head start on the Friday afternoon traffic heading north. Unfortunately however, we had left it a little late and ended up spending 5 hours on the A1.</p>\n<p>We had packed a lot into our 3 and half days in London but there was still a bunch of places on our original itinary that we didn’t manage to fit in. At least we would have another chance when we later returned from Paris before our flight out of Heathrow to Hong Kong three weeks later.</p>\n",

Well that was the plan. We got there shortly after 8am only to find it was shut. Perhaps it only opens for breakfast on the weekends? We’ve only ever been on the weekends before.</p>\n<p>So then we went to Raby Bay only to find the restaurants and cafes were all shut there too. We ended up at the Coffee Club at Capalaba Park mall. Not exactly the views we were after but the breakfast did manage to sort out my minor hangover from the work End of Financial Year party the night before.</p>\n<p>We had a day flight, leaving on a Qantas Boeing 747 to Singapore. It was the first time that we had flown with Qantas and I was pleasantly surprised. The food, leg-room, entertainment system, all good, no complaints.</p>\n<p>We had booked into the <a href=\"http://www.rwsentosa.com/language/en-US/Hotels/HardRockHotel\">Hard Rock Hotel</a> on Sentosa Island, which is part of <a href=\"http://www.rwsentosa.com/\">Resorts World Sentosa</a>.</p>\n<p>Resorts World Sentosa is a mega-resort that opened in 2010 and is home to integrated hotels, casino, Universal Studios, Marine Life Park, and a number of other attractions that are all inter-connected across the island by monorail and cable car.</p>\n<p>We arrived at our hotel early evening. We’ve been to Singapore a few times now but never fail to be surprised by the 100% humidity that slaps you in the face as you emerge from the air-conditioned cocoon of the airport or hotel. Brisbane is sub-tropical so the humidity is high most of the year, but it’s nothing compared to Singapore, or most of South-East Asia for that matter. I couldn’t imagine living in those conditions year-round. No wonder much of South-East Asia is one air-conditioned mall after the next.</p>\n<p>Another characteristic of Singapore is the grey skies. I don't think I've ever been to Singapore and seen the sun. The humidity causes a permanent haze over the island which, unfortunately, is not very good for the photographs. The grey skies are deceiving - you can still get sunburnt within minutes, as we found to our cost on a previous visit.</p>\n<p>The hotel was pretty snazzy, with reminders that you’re staying in a Hard Rock hotel everywhere - from the pictures of Jimmy Hendrix on the wall to the toiletries in the bathroom presented in a mini guitar box. Of course, there’s also an Hard Rock Cafe and the obligatory Hard Rock shop.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7376383f9a.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel room\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-5.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4b24590014.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel bathroom\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-6.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After checking out the room we headed out to explore the resort. The hotel is directly adjacent to FestiveWalk which has a plethora of restaurants, shops, fountains and bright lights leading up to the Merlion.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/baf1243dac.jpg\" alt=\"FestiveWalk Sentosa\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"festive-walk.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/277aa20761.jpg\" alt=\"Merlion - Singapore\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"merlion-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The intention of our weekend on Sentosa was to start the holiday off with a bit of relaxation before the madness of the city visits ahead. The next day (Saturday) fully lived up to the billing. Lauren was in her element thanks to the hotel’s large pool with lots of nooks and crannies for her to explore. Rach and I were also sorted thanks to the swim-up bar and the lovely cocktails. God knows how many Mojitos and Singapore Slings I got through that weekend.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/73431547d6.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel pool\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-1.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6901ea5139.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel pool bar\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The following day we had tickets to the Universal Studios theme park. We expected to spent most of the day there but we were finished by early afternoon. I know theme parks grow over time and this one is new, but when you’ve been to the Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, this is like going to a school fair by comparison.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/391e2f2073.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Studios Singapore\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"universal-studios-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>To enhance the experience we had purchased express passes to allow us to skip to the front of the lines. It adds more expense to the day but it’s definitely worth it - queuing for an hour in 100% humidity for a ride that lasts 60 seconds is not my idea of fun.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c004711956.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Studios\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"universal-studios-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Lauren had a great time and there were a few rides that we all loved, but in general, I would say the theme parks on the Gold Coast 40mins from our house are just as good, if not better.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ff1fd473c2.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Studios\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"universal-studios-3.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4b698d9303.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Studios\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"universal-studios-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The good thing about Universal Studios it it’s only a short walk back to our hotel, so back to the pool we went.</p>\n<p>In the evenings we sampled some of the restaurants. On the Saturday night we went to an American Blues bar which promised Cajun food and live Blues music. The food was bland and they did that thing of bringing the starters and mains out at the same time, which is always a bit bizarre for non-asian food. On the Sunday evening we went to a restaurant specialising in local cuisine. This was better but nothing to write home about.</p>\n<p>After eating we walked around FestiveWalk. The lights and the music result in a nice buzz to the place in the evening, but it wasn't long before the humidity would leave us in a sweaty mess and wanting to retreat back to the hotel bar and air-conditioning. Luckily the hotel bar made some fantastic cocktails.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/feab7b236e.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel cocktail bar\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Monday was our final day on Sentosa. In the morning we took the monorail over to the other side of the island (less than 10 mins) to check out the beach area. Strangely the place was deserted. I’ve no idea why no one was around. There’s a few more hotels and attractions on that side of the island. Perhaps the hotel guests prefer to stay around the pool than head to the beach.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6c03dc567e.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa beach\" style=\"border:0;\" title=\"sentosa-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>After taking a paddle we decided to have a go at one of the attractions before heading back. There were a few to choose from but as soon as we saw it our minds were made up - Segways! It was our first time on a Segway. What fun. Afterwards we all said the same thing - I want one!</p>\n<p>I remember when the Segway was first announced on the news a few years ago. The announcement was that tomorrow a revolutionary invention would be unveiled that would change the world. Mmm, it’s not quite had the impact that the inventors expected but it really is a fantastic piece of machinery. It doesn’t take long at all to get the hang of it and the gyroscope makes it virtually impossible to fall off. I was leaning forwards as far as possible to try and make it go faster but there was never any danger of completely toppling over.</p>\n<p>The price of the Segway means that it’s currently limited to the odd tourist company and urban police, such as <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/101305127329503814686/albums/5632863371622921937/5632864394406518114?authkey=CNuvtJbEpOumZQ\">this one</a> I spotted while I was in Omaha in the US. Hopefully one day the economies of scale will finally be reached so that we can all afford one. I can’t see that happening any time soon though. Perhaps a good thing considering the obesity epidemic in the western world.</p>\n<p>After tearing around an off-road track on a Segway we took the monorail back to FestiveWalk, where we enjoyed one final attraction before heading back to the hotel - the Sentosa Cable Car over the island, across to the Singapore mainland and back.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ea7c17dc22.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa Cable Car\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"sentosa-6.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5028c55b63.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa Cable Car\" style=\"margin:5px;border:0;\" title=\"sentosa-4.jpg\" />\n<br style=\"clear:both;\" />\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1b7aa4833a.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa \" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"sentosa-5.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/af04664d4a.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa looking to Singapore mainland\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"sentosa-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>We had a late flight Monday evening so I asked reception if we could get a late check-out. They obliged by extending it from 12pm to 1pm - not quite the late check-out I had in mind. It didn’t really matter though. We were able to use the locker room facilities next to the pool so that we could have one final afternoon around the pool and get a shower and change of clothes before leaving for the airport.</p>\n<p>Sentosa Island was a great start to the trip and is a fantastic purpose-built family holiday destination. We visited at the right time of the year - mid September. It was fairly quiet which meant no fighting for a sun-bed or a seat at the swim-up bar. It was bliss! I’d highly recommend Sentosa if you’re visiting Singapore, it makes a nice contrast to the wall-to-wall malls on the mainland.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8e45f5a95f.jpg\" alt=\"Sentosa\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"sentosa-1.jpg\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e2a587df17.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel cocktail\" style=\"border:0;margin:5px;\" title=\"hard-rock-hotel-4.jpg\" /></p>\n",

When it came to it however, the itinerary was that packed that for the first 3 weeks there was not a single hour spare to sit down and do some writing, and for the final week I was simply too exhausted to care.</p>\n<div class=\"in-post-widget\">\n<h3>Trip Series Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/942/europe-trip-2012-part-1\">Part 1: The Planning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/970/europe-trip-2012-part-2-sentosa-island\">Part 2: Sentosa Island</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1002/europe-trip-2012-part-3-london\">Part 3: London</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1031/europe-trip-2012-part-4-family-and-friends\">Part 4: Friends and Family</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1049/europe-trip-2012-part-4-venice\">Part 5: Venice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1066/europe-trip-2012-part-6-grindelwald\">Part 6: Grindelwald</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/1108/europe-trip-2012-part-7-paris\">Part 7: Paris</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2930/europe-trip-2012-part-8-london-hong-kong-home\">Part 8: London - Hong Kong - Home</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>The Planning</h2>\n<p>After the disaster which was our honeymoon in Nov 2010 (I never covered it on here, it was too depressing), we decided our next overseas trip would be back to the UK. After all, we emigrated here in May 2007 and hadn’t been back once, whereas in that time our parents had visited us twice.</p>\n<p>We knew that we would need a month - flying to the other side of the world and coming back just two weeks later is no fun. We also knew that we would want to use the opportunity to see Europe, and not just our home towns of Worksop and Doncaster. Four weeks in Worksop and Doncaster is not my idea of a holiday.</p>\n<p>We began saving. We told ourselves that we would make the most of the trip and although we wouldn’t go mad, it wouldn’t be a budget holiday either; the itinerary would dictate the budget not the other way round.</p>\n<p>We worked out rough dates. We wanted Lauren to miss as little school as possible, but at the same time we wanted to travel at an optimal time taking into account cost and weather conditions. The summer school holidays in Australia run from Christmas through to the end of January. We briefly considered booking for Christmas 2011 but it was only a fleeting thought. It’s one of the busiest times for travelling so we knew that flights and hotels would be expensive, even if we booked well in advance. Plus, it would be Winter. Maybe Christmas in Finland is magical but that’s not the term I’d use to describe December in the UK!</p>\n<p>We considered Jun/Jul/Aug this year. It was a great summer for London and the UK in general with the Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics, but as a visitor I didn’t fancy the extra crowds and expense that would inevitably ensue. Also, I get really bad hayfever during the UK summers, a condition that I really don’t miss.</p>\n<p>We finally decided on Sep/Oct 2012. It would tie in with half-term so Lauren wouldn’t have to miss too much school, and all the travel books recommend visiting the major cities during the shoulder months either side of summer. We could have gone during the European spring this year but Sept would give us a bit more time to save.</p>\n<h2>Flight Booking</h2>\n<p>With that decided we set about looking for flights. I haven’t used a travel agent since the 90’s. With Tripadvisor, flight comparison sites, travel forums, etc, who needs them? Again, the brief we gave ourself was that the flight must be a good compromise between affordability and the inclusion of stopovers somewhere nice. In the three trips we did to Australia from Europe, including emigrating, we always had a stopover. For one, it’s a chance to see a different part of the world, and two, the flight through to the other side of the world is a killer if, like me, you have problems sleeping or airplanes.</p>\n<p>We ideally wanted stopovers in places we haven’t visited before. That ruled out Singapore, Dubai and Los Angeles - perhaps the most common stopovers between the UK and Australia. I really fancied visiting San Francisco and Seattle. When I looked into it though all the flights from Brisbane pretty much go via LA, first requiring flight changes to SF or Seattle, so it would have been expensive and would have added a fair few hours to the travelling time. We’re saving San Francisco and Seattle up for a future trip. We’d like to drive the west coast of America from San Francisco up to Seattle and then over the border to Vancouver.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, after much research we found affordable flights with Qantas and British Airways. I say surprisingly because usually they’re amongst the dearest with Singapore Airlines and Emirates being the cheapest. We settled on Singapore on the way out and Hong Kong on the way back. Yes we have been to Singapore before (this would be my third time) but we would make this time different by staying on Sentosa Island.</p>\n<p>I spent countless hours researching every aspect of this trip and the lessons I learnt from booking these flights were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We get ripped off in Australia. It’s often nearly twice as dear to fly from Australia to Europe as it is the other way round.</li>\n<li>Just because you live in Australia (or any other country for that matter) you don’t have to book flights using websites in your own country. We got our flights cheapest using <a href=\"http://www.orbitz.com\">orbitz.com</a>. The site I recommend now for flight comparisons is <a href=\"http://www.hipmunk.com\">hipmunk.com</a>.</li>\n<li>The earlier you book the better. You can get some bargains closer to the date but in general flights are cheapest when they first become available.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Itinerary</h2>\n<p>With the flights booked and the dates of travel locked in the next step was to determine our itinerary. This is something that evolved over time right up until leaving. Hotels can generally be cancelled without charge up to 24 hours before the arrival time (unless you get a deal which doesn’t allow cancellation without charge), nevertheless, once we decided on a place we stuck to it. The only exception was the hotel on Sentosa Island - I later managed to find a good deal at what we thought was a better hotel.</p>\n<p>London was on the list. We both love London and it’s been a while since we’ve been. I lived in London for 6 months during my time in the Navy but you could spend a year in London and not see everything. Also, it’s a vibrant world-class city that never stands still and I wanted Lauren to experience it. We took her as a small child but she can’t remember it.</p>\n<p>Also on the list was Venice. We both love Italy. Our last trip to Italy was a few years ago when we enjoyed a fantastic long weekend in Rome courtesy of a cheap flight with Ryan Air. Those cheap European flights is something we’ve really missed since emigrating. I visited Italy countless times during my Navy years but never really appreciated it. I was young and stupid and in those days judged a place by the quality of its pub crawl.</p>\n<p>I visited Trieste in Italy about 5 times when I was in the Navy. Trieste is roughly a 90 min drive from Venice but I never ventured over to Venice because I made a promise to my girlfriend at the time (who was to become my first wife) that I wouldn’t go to Venice without her. In fairness this was because the first time my ship had planned to visit Trieste I made arrangements to take shore leave and spend a few days in Venice with her - arriving on New Year’s Eve. Due to operational reasons the ship couldn’t make it to Trieste and I had to ring her at the last minute to tell her to cancel it. This happened a lot in the Navy and was one of many reasons that I left after 7 and a half years - you couldn’t plan anything.</p>\n<p>My first trip to Italy after leaving the Navy was with Rachelle when we got a cheap Ryan Air flight to Rimini for a couple of days. It was out of season but it was a completely different experience to my time in the Navy. We instantly fell in love with Italian culture and particularly the cuisine.</p>\n<p>Also on the list was Paris. My only previous trip to France was to Bordeaux, again during the Navy. My only memory of Bordeaux is getting very drunk, leaving a nightclub on my own and getting lost trying to find my way back to the ship. After walking in the wrong direction for 2 hours, in my inebriated state I managed a “où est le maritime” to someone in a Shell petrol station who finally directed me in the right direction. I didn’t have enough money for a taxi.</p>\n<p>Rachelle had visited Paris as a teenager during one of her many French exchange visits. She didn’t like it at the time and had a panic attack under the Eiffel Tower. She was in no rush to re-visit but I managed to convince her that you can’t judge a place by your experience as a teenager. As it happens her visit to Paris this time only went as far as the Eiffel Tower, but I’ll come to that later.</p>\n<p>Of course, we wanted to spend a good amount of time with family and friends so we needed to factor that into the equation. A good chunk of the visit would be spent in the UK but we also saw this as an opportunity to visit a few places in the UK which we had never got around to visiting previously.</p>\n<p>Finally, we realised the itinerary was looking very city-heavy, so we wanted to go somewhere completely different to break it up a little.</p>\n<p>I already had in mind that I’d like to travel between Venice and Paris via rail. I like travelling by rail in Europe. I hold quite a fondness for rail travel as it was my main method of transport during my time in the navy (besides ships of course) - I didn’t sit my driving test until I left the Navy. If only Queensland Rail were as clean, fast, efficient and comfortable as the trains in Europe.</p>\n<p>I took a look at the rail routes between Venice and Paris, and straight away the Swiss Alps jumped out at me as an ideal mid-point. I remember reading an article a while ago about the Bernini Express and had dreamt about gliding through the Alps with snow-capped mountains on either side ever since.</p>\n<p>After more research and discussions with Rach we settled on the small town of Grindelwald near Interlaken, in the Jungfrau region of Switzerland. This would be my first time to Switzerland (it’s land-locked).</p>\n<h2>Rail Bookings in Europe</h2>\n<p>Benefit from my many hours of research into rail travel in Europe and know this - do not book via RailEurope.com. You can get much cheaper tickets booking directly with the rail companies that you will be travelling with.</p>\n<p>We purchased our tickets between Venice and Grindelwald through TrenItalia and the Grindelwald to Paris tickets were purchased through SBB. For some reason SBB didn’t offer e-tickets for part of the journey so we had to get them delivered. It was much cheaper to get them delivered to our parent’s house in the UK than delivered to Australia - if I remember right the delivery charge would have been 50% of the ticket price to Australia</p>\n<p>After Grindelwald and Paris the plan was then to take the Eurostar back to London to catch our flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong for a few days, and then home to Brisbane.</p>\n<h2>Rick Steves Europe Guides</h2>\n<p>We had a rough itinerary worked out: Brisbane > Sentosa Island > London > Doncaster/Worksop > other UK places TBD > Venice > Grindelwald > Paris > London > Hong Kong > Brisbane.</p>\n<p>The planning for this trip started last December - a good nine months before we were to travel. This doesn’t sound like much but to me it was a lifetime. I’m used to being spontaneous and getting last minute deals.</p>\n<p>I then discovered a new hobby - reading travel guides! I’ve always been a fan of Lonely Plan travel guides but I’ve finally discovered <a href=\"http://www.ricksteves.com/\">Rick Steves</a>. Now I live in Australia I shop through amazon.com rather than amazon.co.uk - they haven’t launched amazon.com.au yet, unfortunately. Being targeted at American readers, Rick Steves travel guides never came across my radar when I used to purchase travel guides from amazon.co.uk.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend Rick Steves travel guides to anyone who is planning a trip to Europe. His guides are much more personal than the Lonely Planet ones and contain a lot of practical advice. He also has a number of free video and audio podcasts that I found invaluable for the planning, and great audio guides to use when visiting the sights.</p>\n<p>My planning for this trip wasn’t limited to reading the travel guides and spending time on the travel forums (mainly Tripadvisor and Fodors). My 2012 New Year’s Resolutions were focused on this trip. To get the most out of it I pledged to a) learn photography and b) study European art, history and literature related to the places we would be visiting. On the first count I didn’t do too bad, although you might think otherwise when you see my Hong Kong photos (I had my camera on the wrong settings). On the second count I’d give myself a grade of C. I did learn a fair bit but as much as I’d like to think of myself as a ‘learned fellow’, the truth is I can only get halfway through one of Shakespeare’s plays before flicking to a Chris Ryan book. Reading about a piece of art is much more interesting when you’re actually standing in front of it. To paraphrase Robin William’s character in Good Will Hunting - reading about the Sistine Chapel isn’t the same as smelling it.</p>\n<p>Using the Rick Steves guides, in consultation with Rach I worked out rough interaries for our days in London, Paris and Venice. I figured I would be more flexible for the other places.</p>\n<p>So, after many months of research and planning we were ready to go. The final itinerary looked like this: Brisbane > Sentosa Island > London > Doncaster/Worksop > Cotswolds > Bath > Longleat House & Safari Park > Doncaster/Worksop > Harry Potter Movie Studios (on the way to the Airport) > Venice > Grindelwald > Paris > London > Hong Kong > Home.</p>\n",

One of the features of TriggerTrap is the ability to take time-lapse photos. I had a go at this recording the sunset shadow slowly setting over Brisbane - approximately 1 photo every minute. Unfortunately I soon got bored stood there next to the camera while the app did its work and only took 16 shots of time-lapse photos. When that converts to a 25 fps HD video it comes out at less than a second. Next time I'll take a chair with me and some warm clothing and do it properly.</p>\n",

We haven't been to <a href=\"http://www.ekka.com.au\">Queensland's largest annual event</a> since 2007 so we thought it was about time we gave it another try. We had a really good day. The Woolworths Fresh Food Pavilion may have had something to do with that, what with the countless wine-tasting stands and assorted gourmet food outlets. A few of my photo's from the day are shown above.</p>\n",

It’s easy to label people and I may not agree with their politics but they were absolutely lovely people. They couldn’t have been more hospitable.</p>\n<p>Being brought up the right way I was a good tourist, respecting their culture and happy to absorb myself in the local customs. I do genuinely enjoy shooting and jumped at the chance when our hosts offered to take us to their local gun club for a shoot. I had to bite my tongue though when they showed me their gun cabinet at home and brought out 9mm and .45mm pistols, as well as an AR–15 assault rifle.</p>\n<p>Being able to go to a shooting club and let off a little steam is one thing, walking around ‘packing heat’ or riding in your car with an assault rifle in your boot is entirely another. It’s not 1836 anymore. The west has been tamed. If the mexicans attempt to invade I’m pretty sure the US armed forces and border police can handle it. This conspiracy theory that citizens should bear arms to keep the government at bay is ridiculous. For one thing, I’m pretty confident the government would win - they have much bigger guns.</p>\n<p>‘Guns don’t kill people, people kill people’, is the common argument amongs the NRA and other pro-gun lobbies - ignoring the mass of data that shows there’s a clear correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths. Last year guns accounted for 9484 deaths in America, as opposed to 468 for Australia, UK, Germany and Canada combined.</p>\n<p>Of course there’s always anomolies. There’s been mass shootings in the UK and the recent massacre in Norway by Anders Behring Breivik, both in countries with tough gun-control laws. Some people are just insane and if they want to find ways to commit mass murder they will. That’s no argument for saying gun control doesn’t work though.</p>\n<p>The fact is, the data shows that if you have a gun in your home or are around people who owns a gun you’re more likely to be a victom of gun-related violence or accidents. In countries with strict gun-laws there’s less people that have guns and less gun-related violence. It’s not rocket science.</p>\n<p>I fully support the right of people to enjoy the sport of shooting but that doesn’t mean you need to keep a gun at home. Go to a licenced shooting club which keeps the guns under lock and key.</p>\n<p>Nothing will change after yesterday’s shooting at the Batman opening in Aurora, Colorado. Nothing changed after the Columbine shooting, the Tuscon shooting, or any of the countless other massacres that have took place in America. Certainly nothing will change this year as it’s an election year. Any candidate that tries to bring up such a deeply divisive issue will just get accused of playing politics.</p>\n<p>The opinion in Australia regarding gun-control used to be pretty split before the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_(Australia)\">Port Arthur massacre</a> in 1996. The aftermath of that trajedy resulted in strict gun laws and the destruction of 700,000 privately owned firearms. Between 1996 and 2003 the <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=1502\">risk of dying by gunshot halved</a>. But that’s Australia, not America. Australia didn’t have the 2nd amendment. As long as 49% of Americans continue to believe that the 2nd amendment is still relevant today nothing will change.</p>\n",

Australia dominated rugby (both codes) and cricket, they were way far ahead of GB in the medals tables at the Olympics, and in Feb 2003 the Socceroos even beat England at football in that disastrous game at Upton Park in which Harry Kewell dominated and England lost 3–1.</p>\n<p>Boy are things different now. England may still be shit at football but in other sports GB has world-beaters across the board. Just look at golf where as of today, Luke Donald, Rory Mcllroy and Lee Westwood are ranked 1, 2 and 3 respectively in the <a href=\"http://www.officialworldgolfranking.com/rankings/default.sps\">world rankings</a>, and England’s test cricket team is world number one.</p>\n<p>For the aussies it came as a bit of a shock when GB finally beat them in the medals table in the Beijing Olympics. (19–14 in Golds and 47–46 overall), and that will almost certainly continue this year in London. A country’s medal count always gets a boost when they are the host nation, and Team GB have made certain that the trend will continue after an investment of $469 (AUD) million (£312 million) in the last 4 years, double that of the green and gold, and more than any other nation from the 205 competing.</p>\n<p>The sitting-down events (cycling, rowing, sailing) gave Team GB the most success in Beijing. That is set to continue in London but there’s also real hopes for the likes of Tom Daley (diving), Mo Farah (5000m/1000m), and Jessica Ennis (heptathlon), amongst many others.</p>\n<p>For the Aussies, swimming will continue to be the best hope of medals. I for one will be cheering on local girl Stephanie Rice, hoping she can repeat the haul of 3 golds that she won in Beijing. Outside the pool Sally Pearson is exciting to watch and as long as she doesn’t slip up like <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-15/pearson-suffers-loss-at-crystal-palace/4131260\">she did at Crystal Palace</a> she’s a good bet for gold in the 100m hurdles. Besides that there’s also high hopes in a number of events, including men’s hockey, sailing, and rowing.</p>\n<p>On the 14th August, myself, Rach and Lauren will finally swear the oath as Australian citizens. That will give us dual citizenship. Between team GB and team Australia it looks like we’re going to have plenty of opportunity to sing alone to Advance Australia Fair or God Save the Queen.</p>\n",

Objectives once deemed indispensable, such as nation-building and counterinsurgency, have been abandoned or downgraded, either because they haven’t worked or because there’s no longer enough time to achieve them. Even the education of girls, a signal achievement of the NATO presence in Afghanistan, is at risk. By the end of 2014, when the last Americans are due to stop fighting, the Taliban will not be defeated. A Western-style democracy will not be in place. The economy will not be self-sustaining. No senior Afghan official will likely be imprisoned for any crime, no matter how egregious. And it’s a good bet that, in some remote mountain valley, even Al Qaeda, which brought the United States to Afghanistan in the first place, will be carrying on.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/07/09/120709fa_fact_filkins?currentPage=all\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/07/09/120709fa_fact_filkins?currentPage=all</a></p>\n",

Gold Coast which I booked with <a href=\"http://goldcoastphototours.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Deluxe Coastal Photo Tours</a>. When I started to plan our upcoming trip back to Europe I set myself a number of objectives to make the most out of the trip, one of which was to learn photography.<p>This will be our first trip back since emigrating in 2007 and it's set to be epic. Besides time in our home towns visting family and friends, our itinerary includes London, Bath, Oxford and the Cotswolds in the UK; Venice; Grindelwald in the Swiss Alps; and Paris. We also have stopovers on Sentosa Island, Singapore on the way out, and Hong Kong on the way back. With that itinerary in mind I've been determined to take my Canon DSLR off automatic settings and learn what I need to in order to capture the best memories from the trip.</p>\n<p>Up until now my main methods of learning have been from YouTube videos, podcasts, magazines and photography websites. Then the other week we were watching <a href=\"http://www.greatsoutheast.com.au/gsec2cqw/week.asp?programID=1&amp;viewMode=thisWeek\" target=\"_blank\">The Great South East</a> on Channel 7 which included a feature on the full day Gold Coast photo tour. I immediately booked a spot.</p>\n<p>At $99 this tour is excellent value. It was a very early start getting to Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast for the scheduled 6am kick-off. Burleigh Heads is at the southern tip of the Gold Coast, roughly a 80 min drive from home. The day started a beach Sunrise session. Unfortunately for us the weather has been crap lately and the clouds put pay to any dramatic sunrise shots.</p>\n<p>After the beach session we went for breakfast which included a post-processing workshop using Adobe Lightroom. I've dabbled with Photoshop but i'm completely new to Lightroom so I found this really useful. Despite the weather which resulted in poor light conditions I think I managed to produce a few decent photo's, the best of which are above.</p>\n<p>After breakfast we went to Natural Bridge in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springbrook_National_Park\" target=\"_blank\">Springbrook National Park</a>. I had never visited this part of the Gold Coast hinterland before and found it to be break-taking, again, despite the crappy weather.</p>\n<p>A photo session here was followed by a picnic lunch and another change to do some more post-processing.</p>\n<p>All in all the day was a great opportunity to put into practice some of the techniques I've been learning in an environment where I could get help and support from the tour organisers and fellow learners.</p>\n",

There’s no chance of England getting any further than the quarter-finals in a major tournament until they change their entire approach to the game.\nWith the right manager who can instil confident, attacking football they may have a chance to reach the semi’s. To win the competition though they would need to beat Spain; a team that has re-defined how football should be played.</p>\n<h2 id=\"posessionposessionposession.\">Possession, Possession, Possession.</h2>\n<p>Spain understand that the key to winning is possession, every time.</p>\n<p>Have you noticed how Spain hardly ever loft a ball into the penalty box directly from a corner? To most of us that might seem a wasted opportunity to attack the goal. To Spain, a corner is an opportunity to lose possession of the ball. That’s why they nearly always play it out. They know that corner kicks can result in, at best, a 50% chance of winning the ball, and those odds aren’t good enough. They know that to create an opportunity and score they need to have possession of the ball, so keeping the ball comes above everything else.</p>\n<p>It’s a numbers game. England may have the passion (or used to at least), but Spain have the brains. It’s like watching a game of chess. They constantly probe their opponents defence looking for weaknesses. They rarely shoot from out of the box because the odds aren’t good enough. Like a corner, long shots are merely opportunities to lose possession. Even on the edge of the penalty box they only shoot if they know they have good odds of scoring. That’s why they get accused of trying to walk the ball into the box.</p>\n<p>Spain doesn’t have the best defence in the world. They don’t need to. Their form of defence is keeping possession of the ball. Just look at the stats. They conceded only one goal in Euro 2012 and only 6 in the last three major tournaments combined. They stack their side with midfielders in every position because these are the players who are best at keeping the ball.</p>\n<p>It was telling that in the final of Euro 2012 they didn’t start with any recognisable strikers. It’s not just because they’ve got outstanding midfielders in the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, and Fabregas who are all capable of scoring goals. It’s because their form of possession football means that sooner or later they know they’re going to get an opportunity where any one of the outfield players can score.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canenglandchange\">Can England Change</h2>\n<p>So the question is, can and should the England team change the way they play to match Spain’s winning formula?</p>\n<p>Most pundits don’t think to seem it’s possible. I was watching the Twitter feed when England lost to Italy and I noticed Michael Owen tweet that people should stop saying that England should play like Spain as England aren’t capable of playing that kind of possession football.</p>\n<p>Is this really true? He would know better than me but surely if England have any hope of winning a major tournament they should at least consider it. It’s not going to happen overnight. England’s players all play in the Premier League which is known for fast-paced, exciting football; which, as a by-product, does not necessarily result in a high percentage of possession for the winning side. Also, when foreign managers from La Liga come to the Premier League they tend to adopt the style played in the Premier League rather than change to the style favoured by Barcelona and Spain.</p>\n<p>In my view, for England to start playing possession football it would need 1) to start in the academies, both at a club and national level, and 2) require more English players to play in foreign leagues, particularly La Liga. Whilst the EPL is full of foreign players there’s only a handful of English players that have made the jump to foreign leagues.</p>\n<p>With the right manager and players could England win a major tournament playing the English way? Perhaps. Spain have a recipe for success but it doesn’t always get the right result. After all, Portugal beat Spain 4–0 in 2010. So does that undermine my argument? I don’t think so. There’s always going to be anomalies in a game where form, fitness, conditions and importantly, luck, play a role. The exception doesn’t disprove the rule.</p>\n<p>With Harry Redknapp in charge you would like to think that England would have had more confidence to keep attacking the opposition as opposed to playing defensively to protect their lead - the tactic that failed miserably in Euro 2012. Harry Redknapp could have got them to the final. They still wouldn’t have beaten Spain though.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I love <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/\">Tom Cruise</a>. There, I’ve said it.\nThe break-up of Tom-Kat seems to have sparked another round of Tom Cruise bashing in the media. I really don’t understand the crazy tag that got assigned to him after jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s sofa. Why was that such a big deal? What’s wrong with showing a bit of passion?</p>\n<p>The other area of criticism is his belief in Scientology. Critics deride this as a cult. They’re probably right, but to me so is Christianity; both involve a heaped tablespoon of delusion. Scientology is all about the money they say. Really, and Christianity isn’t? I’ve been to that blinged-up palace of opulence that they call The Vatican. According to the bible ‘It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.’ (Mark 10:25). Tell that to those evangelical TV preachers or the Vatican’s bank manager.</p>\n<p>Who knows what Tom Cruise is like in real-life? Who cares? All I know is that his movies are awesome. They may not be up there with Citizen Kane in the usual all-time best movies list, but so what, those lists have nothing to do with the enjoyability quotient of films.</p>\n<p>Here’s a list of my top-ten Tom Cruise films:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Firm</li>\n<li>Jerry Maguire</li>\n<li>Cocktail</li>\n<li>Top Gun</li>\n<li>Risky Business</li>\n<li>Mission Impossible</li>\n<li>Collateral</li>\n<li>A Few Good Men</li>\n<li>Mission: Impossible 3</li>\n<li>Minority Report</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See, I haven't even included Rain Man in the top ten and yet Rain Man is a great film</p>\n<p>His films are enjoyable, memorable and quotable. There’s hardly a day goes by when I don’t say to Lauren ‘<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002WZTOI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0002WZTOI\">Negative Ghost Rider, the pattern is full</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0002WZTOI\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" />’ in response to any one of her ‘Daddy can I please…’.</p>\n<p>He’s not immune to the odd dud movie. Vanilla Sky was extremely misjudged, Days of Thunder gets called Top Gun on wheels but it’s no where near as good, and All the Right Moves, one of his early movies, is very forgettable. Mission Impossible 2 was an abomination. They should have never let John Woo anywhere near it.</p>\n<p>Eyes Wide Shut gets a lot of criticism but I don’t mind it. Despite the strange, drawn-out dialogue, I found the plot quite compelling, if not a little weird. I didn’t like Magnolia the first time I watched it but it has since grown on me.</p>\n<p>The Outsiders is a great adaptation of a modern classic novel, and I loved TAPS when I watched it as a teenager. War of the Worlds is good as is Born on the Fourth of July - a performance deserving of his Academy Award nomination.</p>\n<p>A few of his films are watchable but a bit ordinary: Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Knight and Day, Valkyrie, Lions for Lambs, The Last Samurai, and Interview with a Vampire I would put in this category.</p>\n<p>Tom Cruise was the best and perhaps only good thing about Tropic Thunder.</p>\n<p>I haven’t seen Rock of Ages yet but it looks good fun, and I’m really looking forward to Jack Reacher.</p>\n<p>There’s still a few more that I haven’t mentioned but that just goes to show what a great back-catalogue he has.</p>\n<p>So leave off!</p>\n",

Honest! I’ve got a certificate and everything. It even came framed:\n<img src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5e4e0a1c62.jpg\" alt=\"GCFE Certificate\" title=\"GCFE\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-681\" /></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.giac.org/certification/certified-forensic-examiner-gcfe\">the blurb</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The GCFE certifies that candidates have the knowledge, skills, and ability to conduct typical incident investigations including e-Discovery, forensic analysis and reporting, evidence acquisition, browser forensics and tracing user and application activities on Windows systems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve got no idea if I’ll get to use these skills. The company I work for is considering applying for us to offer <a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/pci_forensic_investigator.php\">PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI)</a> services, and in order to become eligible there needs to be a number of us suitably qualified. If I were to become a PFI it would sit nicely beside my current <a href=\"/blog/224/pci-qsa\">PCI QSA</a> designation, so as well as auditing organisations to ensure they adequately protect credit card information, I could also be called on to conduct a forensic investigation in the event they suffered a breach of cardholder data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sans.org/security-training/computer-forensic-investigations-windows-in-depth-1207-mid\">The course</a> was fairly intense but it mainly focused on Windows forensics. I’ll probably need to follow this up with the <a href=\"https://www.sans.org/security-training/advanced-computer-forensic-analysis-incident-response-5226-tid\">Advanced Computer Forensic Analysis and Incident Response</a> course so I can thoroughly investigate attacks across the network and on multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed the course. The technical aspects were superb and the forensic toolkit that shipped with the course has already come in useful. The course is not just technical however, it also covers the procedural side of forensics and e-Discovery. This is necessary, but being a US-based course it was based on US federal legislation and procedures. I’ll need to bone up on the related Australian legislation and evidentiary procedures to ensure I’m doing the right things to satisfy chain of custody and admissability of evidence for any investigations here.</p>\n",

So was the case with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UXUX4Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004UXUX4Q\">The Descendants</a>.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1376\">From the opening narration in which he explains that living in paradise doesn’t necessarily mean that life is paradise, George Clooney is captivating in the role of Matt King, a descendant of one of Hawaii’s first white land-owning families.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1379\">Matt’s extended family, which is spread across the Hawaii islands, has a decision to make as to whether to sell a large plot of highly desirable beachfront virgin forest on Kauai to developers, who will inevitably open it up for tourist development.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1382\">Most of the family have already made their mind up. To them it’s a no-brainer - the sale will make them all rich. However, as the sole trustee of the land, Matt has the ultimate responsibility to make the final decision - a decision that forces him to consider the opposing views of his family and the islanders who want the land to remain unspoilt. This is all at the same time as facing a personal crisis.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1385\">At the beginning of the film we see that Matt’s wife is involved in a water skiing accident which puts her in a coma. This forces Matt to effectively become a single parent to his two daughters, one of whom is the teenager Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) who returns from boarding school with a bad attitude.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1388\">The bad attitude is borne out of resentment; resentment for her father who up until then has always put his business before his family, and resentment for her mother who, unbeknownst to Matt, has been having an affair with another man.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1391\">Rocked by his wife’s accident, Matt’s world comes crashing down once again when Alexandra blurts out the truth about his wife. This devastating, dramatic moment for the main character actually sets the stage for one of the films funniest scenes, as George Clooney, looking completely un-cool in high-waisted khaki shorts and Hawaiian shirt, slips on a pair of thongs (flip-flops) and runs down the mountain to challenge the friends of his wife who must have known about the affair. If you’ve ever attempted to run in thongs you can imagine how ungainly this looks.</p><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0007TKOAA\" title=\"\" alt=\"\" /><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1395\">If I tell you that The Descendants is written and directed by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0668247/\">Alexander Payne</a>, who previously wrote and directed another favourite of mine - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0007TKOAA\">Sideways</a>, you may know that you’re not just getting a moving, family drama. A wonderful black humour ripples throughout this movie, at times blending tragedy and hilarity within the same scene.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1404\">The bulk of the story follows Matt moving around the Hawaii islands attempting to track down his wife’s lover, at the same time as trying to deal with his unruly daughter and her brain-dead friend Sid, who is the source for many of the laughs throughout the film. The carefully crafted script ensures that the business, family and emotional troubles are tied together expertly in the final scenes.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1407\">The movie is scored throughout with beautiful, soft, Hawaiian music - the kind of music you want to listen to whilst sat at a beach bar on a tropical paradise island watching the sun descend over the horizon.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_75_1519598864948_1410\">After watching a lot of films lately which were, frankly, disappointing, it was a joy to sit down to something which gripped me from beginning to end. George Clooney fully deserves his Oscar nomination for this film.</p>\n",

This was genuinely a new idea expertly executed by a great director - Christopher Nolan.</p>\n<p>So when I saw the trailer for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWZW7E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004LWZW7E\">In Time</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004LWZW7E\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" />\n I was hoping that this would be the next in a new era of interesting films based on an original concept. </p>\n<p>It certainly has the potential from the synopsis. In Time is set in the future where people stop ageing at the age of 25 and are engineered to live only 1 more year. To continue living people have to purchase top-ups of time, just like topping up a mobile phone balance. There is no money as such - time is the currency. People work and receive their income in units of time, and everything is paid for with those units of time.</p>\n<p>This world of the future is much like today; the rich can top-up with decades at a time, essentially becoming immortal, while the poor have to beg, borrow or steal enough hours just to make it through the day. </p>\n<p>Justin Timberlake plays Will Salas, a man in the latter category who, through being in the wrong place at the wrong time, gets falsely accused of murder and is forced to go on the run with a hostage - Sylvia Weis, played by Amanda Seyfried.</p>\n<p>There's not much more you need to know. Unlike Inception, this isn't going to make you want to go back and watch it again to make sure you followed it all. </p>\n<p>In Time tries to tread a line between being a popcorn Sci-fi on one hand, and a social commentary on the inherent unfairness in capitalism on the other. It's somewhere between Robin Hood and Bonnie and Clyde.</p>\n<p>The message is a little muddled though. A number of times in the film Will Salas is questioned about the morality of stealing and his reply is 'Is it wrong to steal if it has already been stolen?', but there's no clarification on what he means. The wealth on show in the area known as New Greenwich seems to be mostly inherited wealth, so in what way has it been stolen?</p>\n<p>As is the custom for these movies, Will Salas does some serious ass kicking. At the beginning of the movie he's an ordinary factory worker, yet halfway through the movie he turns into James Bond, taking baddies out with comical ease. Unless I missed it there's no explanation of where he got his fighting and shooting skills.</p>\n<p>Also, some of the special effects were decidedly dodgy. In particular there's one where the car the 'goodies' are driving flips over. It reminded me of that scene in Die Another Day where the Drag Racing car falls over the side of the ice cliff. I was looking for the strings - very Thunderbirds-esque.</p>\n<p>If I were rating this film on quality I'd probably give it 2 stars but my ratings are simply based on how much I enjoyed the film. Despite all the flaws it is fairly entertaining, hence 3 stars. Just take my advice - turn off your brain at the start of the film!</p>\n",

I’m aware of his work and had an idea what to expect. I’ve got <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KGBISE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003KGBISE\">Antichrist</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003KGBISE\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" /> queued up to watch but haven’t dared to sit through it yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006KH6CF4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006KH6CF4\">Melancholia</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B006KH6CF4\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" /> tells the story of two sisters and is in two parts. Part 1 focuses on Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her wedding day. To begin with she seems like any normal newly wed - deliriously happy and truly in love. It isn’t long, however, until we learn that something is not quote right with Justine. She suffers from depression, maybe she’s bi-polar, it isn’t spelt out. As the night progresses the demons inside her take hold and self-destruction begins.</p>\n<p>The second half focuses on her sister - Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and her anxiety caused by the impending event.</p>\n<p>I should mention at this point that the impending event is the potential end of the world. I’m not giving anything away here as the end of the world takes place in the first 5 minutes of the movie. A completely bizarre opening which features slow-motion images of scenes from throughout the film set to the haunting strings of Wagner, culminating in a planet, which we later learn is called Melancholia, approaching and colliding with Earth.</p>\n<p>I can’t say I particularly enjoyed this film. The first half was fairly interesting, albeit flawed. The second half was simply boring. How can the impending end of the world be so boring? The film seemed to just drag on and on and on.</p>\n<p>Melancholia is not a mainstream movie. It’s an art piece which was nominated for the Palm d’Or at last year’s Cannes Film Festival. It has been nominated for a number of different awards and has received a lot of good reviews from film critics. </p>\n<p>When I read reviews of art pieces such as this it makes me wonder whether the 5 star rating is due to the critic generally thinking it is a great movie, or, because they want to be part of the pretentious intelligentsia club and don’t want people to think they don’t understand the underlying meanings of the film.</p>\n<p>I got that Melancholia is a film that explores mental illness. I could see that the anxiety that increased within Claire as Melancholia came ever closer to Earth was used as a metaphor for how depression works; the growing feeling of despair that builds up even though you know there’s no logical reason for it. I get all that and I’m sure that people who have suffered with depression will find Melancholia painfully familiar. That doesn’t make it a great film though.</p>\n<p>I’m not averse to arty independent films, and I don’t necessarily mind strange films, but even strange films should have their own internal logic. The actions of some of the characters in Melancholia just didn’t seem plausible. For example, the idea that Justin’s boss would set her a work task on her own wedding night, and her mother acting the way she does at her own daughters wedding reception, just didn't ring true. There are some callous people out there but does anyone seriously know anybody that would behave in that way?</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the film that grated was the camera work. Yet another film using the annoying ‘shaky’ hand-held camera technique. </p>\n<p>On the positive there is a good supporting cast, including Kiefer Sutherland, John Hurt and Stellan Skarsgård. It’s hard to watch Kiefer Sutherland though and not think of Jack Bauer. When Justine’s mother pissed him off at the wedding reception I was half expecting him to do some arse kicking!</p>\n<p>Talking about Jack Bauer, a lot of the camera angles used in Melancholia seemed to be copied directly from the later seasons of 24, such as filming conversations as if observed from half-hidden behind a corner. Those type of techniques could work in horror or spy films but it’s really unnecessary for what’s basically a drama.</p>\n<p>Also on the positive side is the cinematography. The setting of the film is never mentioned and it’s made hard to discern by the mixed nationality of the characters - there’s no explanation why Justine has got an American accent, whereas her sister and parents are English. It looked to me like the film was shot in Scotland but I now know the exterior shots were largely shot around Tjolöholm Castle in Sweden, and it does look stunning.</p>\n<p>This is the second film of 2011 that I’ve watched about another planet approaching Earth, the other being <a href=\"/blog/579/another-earth-2011\">Another Earth</a>, and in both films the other planet is used mainly as a plot device. Neither film is worth a second viewing.</p>\n",

We learn throughout the film how good he is and how well regarded he is by his peers. When he goes to the trade shows he doesn’t need to fall for the patter of the sales guys - he makes all his own equipment, perfectly tuned to his needs.</p>\n<p>Like many of the great films of the 70’s, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O7I6SE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003O7I6SE\">The Conversation</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003O7I6SE\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" /> requires a little patience. It’s a tad slow in the first half but it’s not for nothing.  The slow pace helps to give us a sense of who Harry Caul is.</p>\n<p>We learn that he’s a surveillance expert now working in New York after an assignment on the West Coast resulted in the death of three people. He likes to see himself as the ultimate professional and tells himself he’s not personally responsible - he was simply hired to do a job. Yet we can clearly see that he’s riddled with guilt, and determined not to get personally affected by any jobs in the future. </p>\n<p>He sees himself as the consummate professional. His job is to record the conversations, not to wonder why his clients want the conversations to be recorded in the first place. The less he knows the better - he can’t feel responsible if he has no clue about the potential consequences.</p>\n<p>He takes the same principles into this latest job. He’s paid to covertly record a conversation between two people in a public park, no easy job when you consider it’s lunch-time in Manhattan so the park is very busy and the subjects are constantly moving - suspicious that they may be being watched</p>\n<p>After successfully making the recordings he needs to deliver a finished product to his client. The initial raw recordings are not much use;  the conversation is distorted and comes in and out as the subjects are constantly moving. We see how Harry fine-tunes and mixes separate sources together, filtering out background interference so that the target conversation slowly but surely becomes audible.</p>\n<p>This is where Harry’s problems begin. The more he listens to the tapes in a repeated effort to capture the full conversation, the more he becomes absorbed by the substance of the conversation taking place. He can’t help but become concerned when he realises the two people being recorded appear to be in grave danger.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, like many security guys, Harry doesn’t ‘eat his own dog food’. Later in the movie the tapes of the recordings are stolen because he fails to secure his workplace properly. He also allows himself to be tricked by a competitor when his private conversation is recorded using a ball-point pen - a gift from the competitor who is so desperate to go into business with him. These lapses from an otherwise diligent professional ends up putting himself in as much danger as he believes the subjects of his recordings are.</p>\n<p>I loved the attention that <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O7I6SE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003O7I6SE\">The Conversation</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003O7I6SE\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" /> paid to Harry’s tradecraft. As a security professional myself it was wonderful to see that tools and methods that Harry uses. It’s also interesting to see how little has changed. The technology may have moved on but everything else seemed very familiar. For example the trade show that Harry attends seems just like any modern-day security conference, just without the Plasma screens; and with vendors trying to get the attendees on their mailing lists instead of email lists as they do today. </p>\n<p>You can’t watch The Conversation now and not think of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428115/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=6305428115\">Enemy of the State</a><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=darylhainesco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=6305428115\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;margin:0!important;\" />\n, in which Gene Hackman plays a very similar role. I wonder if Gene Hackman chose the role in Enemy of the State because he loved playing Harry Caul, or the producers of Enemy of the State chose Gene Hackman because he was so great in The Conversation?</p>\n<p>The Conversation came out two years after the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal\">Watergate scandal</a> and the influence is clear to see; exploring the themes of paranoia, invasion of privacy and its consequences. The Conversation is not an action-paced thriller like Enemy of the State, it’s more mysterious and cerebral.</p>\n<p>As the pieces come together, The Conversation culminates with a shocking twist - a twist which I’m glad I didn’t see coming. Even after the film had finished it took a couple of hours for me to fully appreciate all the intricacies of the plot.</p>\n",

With the third movie in the franchise now out I thought I’d give it a go to see if it’s as bad as the reviews suggest. It is.</p>\n<p>The first Transformers movie was passable, just. But once you’ve seen cars turn into robots the novelty soon wears off.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IPFWTE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=darylhainesco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002IPFWTE\">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a> is basically Transformers 1, just louder and with even more robots hitting each other. Thirty minutes in and I was already forcing myself to stay awake.</p>\n<p>When there were actual human beings on screen having a conversation, it wasn’t too bad, but as soon as it switched again to yet another action scene it quickly lost me.</p>\n<p>The problem with the big spectacle action set pieces is that they’re 90% CG. Yes, CG has come a long way in the last few years but it’s still not anywhere near realistic. Go back and look at a spectacular action scene shot before CG, such as the train crash near the beginning of The Fugitive. A lot of money way spent on that scene and it really is breathtaking and realistic - because it uses real, tangible objects. CG just doesn’t have the depth. It’s like watching a computer game.</p>\n<p>Michael Bay publicly admitted that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was below even his own poor par (his exact words were \"When I look back at it, that was crap”). Apparently that was after Shia LaBeouf declared that he \"wasn't impressed with what we did”.</p>\n<p>I really don’t know if I can be bothered to watch the next one.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>2010 was such a great year. I was lucky enough to travel the world to many places I’ve never visited before, and the year culminated in our fantastic wedding; a perfect day made even better by the visit of family and friends we haven’t seen since we emigrated.\nSo maybe it shouldn’t be such a surprise that to provide balance, 2011 would turn out to be shite!</p>\n<p>The other day I was trying to think of something I’ve achieved during 2011, some objective completed for which I can be proud. I struggled to come up with anything. In retrospect I’m glad I didn’t make any new year’s resolutions last year as they would be a big, fat failure.</p>\n<p>At least I can be proud of Lauren. She turned 10 this year and I think we’ve done a fine job of raising her even if I do say so myself. There’s always the danger with a single child that she’ll be a selfish, spoilt little brat. I may be biased or blinkered (what parent isn’t?), but I certainly don’t see any sign of that in Lauren.</p>\n<p>The main setbacks for me personally this year have been my health. I somehow managed to get kidney stones and gallstones at the same time, which took an age to properly diagnose and resulted in multiple trips to A&amp;E, and eventually led to the removal of my gall bladder. When your health goes south everything else tends to take a back-burner. So much of this year was a write-off.</p>\n<p>At least 2011 was a great year to be a spectator. For a news junkie like me, 2011 will go down in history as a remarkable year, what with the Arab Spring; earthquake in Japan and Fukishima disaster; deaths of Osama Bin Laden, Steve Jobs, and Kim Jong-Il; Brisbane floods; UK riots; Wikileaks cables; phone-hacking scandal and the closure of the News of the World, etc.</p>\n<p>On the business front, all the stats are looking great for IPChitChat, certainly compared to 2010 and taking into account everyone was bracing for a global economic meltdown. I can’t take much credit for this. Michael, my business partner in the UK, has done a stellar job improving revenue and profit, and I’m hoping I can do more to contribute in 2012. We had a couple of other web projects that I was going to launch in 2011 which didn’t happen. I’m planning to get at least one of these off the ground early this year.</p>\n<p>Professionally, I’m still enjoying the day job and I’m hoping I can pick up some interesting work in 2012. There’s certainly no signs of IT Security work taking a slump!</p>\n<p>At least the year ended with a nice relaxing Christmas. I still can't get used to seeing fake snow on the front lawns of gardens in the middle of summer but I'm slowly getting more adjusted to the Aussie xmas. This christmas day was spent like many others since we arrived in Brisbane - nice long christmas lunch interspersed with dips in the pool. It may not be traditional but sitting in the pool with a glass of wine isn't a bad way to spend christmas day! </p>\n<p>Oh well, onwards and upwards. I have high hopes for 2012. The flights are booked for our first trip back to the UK since emigrating in 2007, in what could turn out to be an epic month. Our draft itinerary already includes Singapore, London, Venice, Paris and Hong Kong. The problem is, the amount of time we're likely to spend in Doncaster and Worksop seems to grow less and less as we discover more places we want to visit around Europe (can you blame us?).</p>\n",

The outbreaks of rioting and general lawlessness as desperation took hold came a little too late in the timeline. I may be being pessimistic about our fellow mankind, but I’d expect society to start to break down much earlier than it does in Contagion. </p>\n<p>There’s far too many self-centred people in this world. Gone are the days when people would pull together as a community like during the blitz in the East End of London. It seems like today it would only take a shortage of Plasma TV’s for cities to resemble Beirut circa 1978.</p>\n<p>Look what happens each Black Friday in the US, or when there’s the rumours of fuel shortages in the UK, or simply during Christmas shopping. Imagine then, what it would be like if there were shortages of something really important, such as food or medical supplies. It would be every man for himself. Furthermore, imagine what it would be like in the US, with 35% of households possessing a gun. It would be like scenes from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082340/\">Escape from New York</a>.</p>\n<p>All of this is portrayed in Contagion but it felt somewhat flat. It’s certainly not a thriller. Contagion is a slow, meticulous drama which focuses on the technicalities faced by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the US and the World Health Organisation (WHO). At times it felt more like a documentary than an exciting edge-of-the-seat thriller about the fight to save mankind.</p>\n<p>Contagion is good enough as 106 mins of though-provoking entertainment, but it could have been so much better. In fact, I reckon <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114069/\">Outbreak</a> is a better movie.</p>\n",

Sometimes I'm attuned to these things, not this time.</p>\n<p>Robert Pattinson plays Tyler Hawkins, a young New Yorker who is grieving for the loss of his brother. </p>\n<p>Tyler doesn’t handle the grief very well. He’s rebellious. He drinks and smokes too much and generally has a bad attitude. He’s clearly got anger issues; the main cause of that anger being his father. He doesn’t explicitly say it, but we can see that he holds his father responsible for the death of his brother.</p>\n<p>Through a twist of fate he meets Ally (Emilie de Ravin). And it is a twist of fate. In a city of 8 million people you have to wonder at the odds that they would meet in the way they do.</p>\n<p>Ally has also been affected by tragedy, and their shared experience and grief helps bring them together.</p>\n<p>At this point you may think this is just another soppy love story. In a way it is, but I found this movie deeply affecting. The characters are engaging. The blossoming relationship between Tyler and Ally is well handled. </p>\n<p>The relationship between Tyler and his father, played by Pierce Brosnan, is probably the most interesting aspect of the film. Pierce Brosnan puts in a great performance, in spite of the slightly dodgy caricature New Jersey accent.</p>\n<p>The plot is like a Shakespearean tragedy. Maybe a bit overdone. After the coincidences that led to Tyler and Ally meeting, we are expected to suspend disbelief again for another set of coincidences that leads to the climactic finale. In an inferior film this would be a problem. In the case of Remember Me I wasn’t bothered by it at all. It was a fitting ending to a powerful and thought-provoking film.</p>\n",

Not so. Instead, this film tries to make us feel sorry for the rich guy - Bobby Walker - a sales executive who loses his extremely cushy job, with a great salary and benefits, and, shock-horror, even loses his Porsche.</p>\n<p>The definition of poverty is relative. To much of the world, poverty may mean living on $1 a day, not having running water or proper sanitisation. To us in the western world the benchmark for poverty is entirely different. As was reported during the UK riots this year, the benchmark for poverty in the UK is not having a second car or Sky +. Surely that can’t be true?</p>\n<p>The story is interesting enough and there’s a great cast, including Ben Affleck (playing Bobby Walker) and Tommy Lee Jones (playing Gene McLary), but if the Director’s aim was for us to empathise with Bobby Walker then he has surely failed.</p>\n<p>There is something extremely unsettling about this film. I felt uncomfortable watching it. Oh look, rich people have problems too. Look at this poor guy, he can no longer afford his country club fees!</p>\n<p>If you’re expecting to see the main character go through a lazarus moment where he comes back from the pits of despair and is transformed by the experience, think again.</p>\n<p>Even at the end, when he finds work in a job where his salary is only half what it was before, there’s no real evidence that he has reformed his thinking in any way. The film ends before we can find out if he repeats the same capitalist excesses. For all we know, he may be just as much of an arrogant, wasteful arsehole as he was before.</p>\n<p>By the way, do you think Ben Affleck’s agent has been instructed to only look at scripts that are set in Boston?</p>\n",

Rhoda Williams is a high school student who has just been accepted to MIT. She has a promising future but her world falls apart one night when, after a night of drinking, she drives and crashes into the Burroughs family, killing the wife and son, and leaving the husband in a coma. </p>\n<p>The second thread, and the event that causes her to lose concentration that night ultimately resulting in the tragic event, is the news on the radio that scientists have discovered a planet moving towards Earth which seems to be an exact replica of our own planet. This planet is quickly dubbed Earth 2.</p>\n<p>The main character, Rhoda Williams, is played by Brit Marling, who also co-wrote the film’s script with first-time director Mike Cahill.</p>\n<p>The husband and father that Rhoda has left in a coma, John Burroughs (William Mapother), is a successful composer and professor. </p>\n<p>Both Rhoda’s and John’s lives are devastated by the crash, but four years later, events transpire to bring them together, in what becomes the focus of the film.</p>\n<p>I love the ideas presented in this film. The plot focuses on the human relationships and the tragedy. The sci-fi element is a back-drop, which becomes more intertwined towards the end. Ultimately, however, it is the lack of focus on the world-changing event that lets Another Earth down. It’s hard to care about the characters and relationships when in the background they’re playing news footage of what could potentially be mankind’s first contact with other lifeforms; the big idea is far more interesting and engaging than the human tragedy.</p>\n<p>Another Earth has a tremendously slow pace. It plods along as if it’s purposefully trying to tell you it’s a film that you must take seriously. I don’t mind slow-paced, independent films built around tragedy. One of my favourites of this type is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385017/\">In My Father’s Den</a> starring Matthew Macfadyen, but Another Earth is not even in the same league as In My Father’s Den.</p>\n<p>The idea of another planet Earth is compelling and brings up many interesting questions. Also, the background scenes of Earth 2 in the night sky along with the moon look really good, but to go along with this film you need to suspend logic and ignore the laws of physics. There are some serious holes in the science. For a start, forget all you know about gravity.</p>\n<p>In general, it’s worth a watch but the concept is far better than the delivery.</p>\n",

We first learn that Barney has a suspect past when he is confronted by a Detective in a bar - a Detective who is clearly frustrated that Barney is still a free man in spite of his attempts to get him convicted for murder. This is the trigger for a flashback to the story that leads Barney to that point - beginning just before his first marriage; a marriage featuring a wedding ceremony that probably qualifies as the most un-romantic in history.</p>\n<p>The detective is played by the superb <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004692/\">Mark Addy</a> - the Yorkshireman who has managed to carve for himself a career in Hollywood on the back of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119164/\">The Full Monty</a>.</p>\n<p>Barney is played with great effect by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0316079/\">Paul Giamatti</a>, an actor who divides opinion in the Haines household. I think Paul Giamatti is outstanding whereas Rachelle finds him annoying. But maybe that’s because I, unlike Rachelle, saw and loved <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/\">Sideways</a> and the incredible HBO series - <a href=\"http://www.tv.com/john-adams/show/75065/summary.html\">John Adams</a>. It was great performances in these that have led to him, with justification, getting lead parts where previously he would only get supporting ones.</p>\n<p>Barney is likeable as a character, yet it feels wrong to like him. After all, this is someone who leaves his own wedding reception to pursue a woman he’s just met at said wedding reception. What is it that gets three women to agree to marry him? Maybe it’s the same charm that makes you like him despite his considerable flaws. This is a man who seems to have no filter for his words or actions; he acts impulsively, seemingly without thought of the consequences to those close to him.</p>\n<p>Barney’s third wife, Miriam, is played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683253/\">Rosamund Pike</a> - the posh British ‘totty’ who most notably, for Bond fans such as myself, played Miranda Frost in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460/\">Die Another Day</a>.  She also had key roles in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1174732/\">An Education</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371155/\">Made in Dagenham</a>, both remarkable movies fully deserving of the positive critical reviews they received.</p>\n<p>Miriam is mesmerising, Far too good for Barney.  When she finally succumbs to his charm you’re left wondering whether she actually likes him or has just given in to his persistence. The question is quickly put to rest as you see their life together progress in the final stages of the film. You’re also left wondering why she puts up with him. Barney has supposedly found the love of his life yet this doesn’t manage to halt his course of self-destruction.</p>\n<p>There’s some great supporting characters too. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000163/\">Dustin Hoffman</a> can be credited with a lot of the movie’s laughs. He plays Barney’s father - a loveable rogue and serial philanderer, who leaves no doubt as to the lineage of Barney.</p>\n<p>To complete the package, Barney’s Version has a great soundtrack, featuring Jazz classics from the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Leonard Cohen, as well as 70’s music befitting the first half of the film.</p>\n<p>I loved Barney’s Version. The story is funny, moving at times, and thoroughly engaging. What’s more, there’s a ring of truth to the scenes; where even the most innocuous moment seems recognisable. Anyone who has had an argument, lied, or been lied to, will recognise the body language and eye movement; the sub-conscious human traits that mark the performance of great actors.</p>\n",

Was it just a case of a lonely old Lesbian wanting to take advantage of the situation to get some action, or could it be something else?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, what started as a highly intriguing story tapered off towards the end leaving me feeling that it should have been so much more. At least the superb writing and acting by the two former Queens and Bill Nighy compensated slightly for the underwhelming plot.</p>\n<p>I found the most engaging aspect of the film to be Barbara Covett’s first-person narration. It reminded me a lot of the narration by Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) in American Psycho. Not to say that Barbara is a serial killer.</p>\n<p>In some movies narration is essentially a cop-out by the Director who doesn’t know how to properly tell the story. In Notes on A Scandal the narration is crucial. It immediately allows us access to Barbara’s bitter, twisted personality; the mask of a lonely old spinster hiding her contempt for ‘modern’ families, the education system, and the superficiality of today’s Britain.</p>\n<p>The narration also gives us some of the best lines. Barbara is clearly a frustrated writer. When she’s not writing in her diary her thoughts are expressed to us as if she’s writing fine literature. An example of this is when she’s sitting on the stairs listening to the argument between Sheba and her husband - “I sat in the gods while the aria unfolded before me”. Sheba sums this up towards the end of the film with a put-down to Barbara “you think you're fucking Virginia Woolf!”.</p>\n<p>Another problem for me was the relationship between Sheba and the 15 year-old student. It seems slightly implausible, as does her marriage to the older husband. But of course, these things happen. Women marry older men, even older men that aren't rich. Affairs between teachers and schoolboys do occur. Although I'm sure not as often as your average 15 year old schoolboys might purport.</p>\n<p>In summary, an interesting enough story, above average writing and acting, but let down by an unfulfilling finale.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204127\">I’ve decided to start writing some short movie reviews on here. I’ve got quite a large DVD collection, most of of which I’ve now copied on to my Apple TV set-up. In my geekness, I’ve got movies stored on a couple of external hard disks connected to my wireless router so that I can stream them wirelessly to any of the Apple TVs. We’ve somehow ended up with 3 in our house. Surely that’s more than is healthy for any small family?\nMy ratings will be based on the 5 stars system. Half stars are allowed so it’s effectively a score out of ten.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204130\">Unlike ‘proper’ critical reviews from bona-fide film critics, my ratings aren’t based on the quality of the film as judged by the usual standards. I simply rate films based on how much I enjoyed them or otherwise appreciated them. For instance, there’s certain comedies that may get a slating by the film critics and have a low rating on IMDB, but if they make me laugh I’m going to give them a higher rating, simple as. </p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204133\">There’s quite a few oscar winners and so-called ‘classics’ that I’ve seen which have bored me to tears. When that’s the case it gets a low rating. I don’t care if it was considered ground-breaking in its time, with beautiful cinematography and a narrative which captures the zeitgeist of the moment.  If I yawned, it gets a low rating. An example which I saw for the first time recently is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041959\">The Third Man (1949)</a>. There’s my invitation to join the British Film Institute out of the window!</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204139\">I’ll very rarely review the latest releases as I generally wait until they’re out on DVD/Blueray. In fact, I’ve now boycotted the cinema after my experience during the last 2 visits. I took the family to see both Super 8 and the final Harry Potter, and on both occasions the experience was ruined by inconsiderate twats; munching, coughing, talking, slurping and causing light pollution from their mobile phones for the entire length of the film. They obviously have no appreciation for the Wittertainment Code of Conduct…</p>\n\n\n \n   [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A-KV_xkrnc&w=640&h=390]\n \n\n<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204145\">I’ve currently got a patent lawyer looking into whether or not anyone else has patented my invention of wireless audio streaming in cinemas to surround-sound headphones that they can hand out like they do 3-D glasses. Not really. You can have that idea for free.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204148\">Talking about 3-D. I’m certainly over that gimmick. I actually like to see a sharp, bright picture, not the slightly blurred, dim experience you get through 3-D glasses, for which you have to pay a premium through the ticket price.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204151\">If I do visit the cinema again it will be to see a film nobody else wants to see. On a Sunday morning. Alternatively, it will be during the Summer to catch one of the Movies in the Park.</p><p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1519598864948_204154\">Then again, open-air cinema isn’t really the place to appreciate a film first time round.  Not when you’re surrounded by heavy-petting teenagers and the dulcet tones of the generator for a burger van whirring away in the background.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>It has been devastating watching the catastrophe unfold in the city that I've grown to love. I've said before that this is the first place where I've truly felt settled. It's the city we chose to live in when deciding to emigrate, and we've never once regretted it.\nMany parts of Brisbane are now a disaster zone, including some of my favourite places. Of course buildings and places can be re-built; there's nothing that can be done to replace the lives that have been lost. </p>\n<p>The heart and soul of Brisbane has been damaged and it's going to be a long time before things are back to normal.</p>\n<p>When we've had visitors arrive from the UK, to give them a good taste of what's best about Brisbane we always used to drive to Bulimba or Hawthorne and take the CityCat catamaran service down the river, around the Central Business District (CBD), and get off at South Bank. The South Bank Parklands being my favourite place in the city. </p>\n<p>The CityCat service has largely been destroyed. Not the catamarans as such, but the majority of the terminals. Similarly, South Bank Parklands have been inundated by the floods.</p>\n<div style=\"float:left;\"><img src=\"http://asset.ninemsn.com.au/img/000/000/139/702/NataliePeluso.jpg\" alt=\"Riverside and Eagle St Pier, Brisbane\" /></div>\n<div style=\"float:left;margin-left:10px;\"><img src=\"http://asset.ninemsn.com.au/img/000/000/139/901/1301_cbd9_sl.jpg\" alt=\"Brisbane flooding\" /></div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" />\nImages courtesy of <a href=\"http://news.ninemsn.com.au/slideshowajax/140024/queensland-devastated-by-floods.slideshow\">Channel 9</a></p>\n<p>It looks like it's going to take 2 years to re-build the areas that are affected. It's going to be a long clean-up process requiring lots of resources. More than 26,000 homes and 5000 businesses in 67 suburbs have been affected. More than 150 roads remain closed and many part of the city are still without power.</p>\n<p>We've been very lucky that we chose to move to the Redlands area. We did look at rental properties in Milton, Toowong and other inner-Brisbane suburbs which have been hit, but chose to move out here instead.</p>\n<p>At work (the day job) we're also looking at what we can do to help out in the community. Our engineers are already hard at work helping out our customers who have been impacted. Many customers had to invoke their Disaster Recovery plans, and we've got quite a few customers who need help re-building their networks to get their business up and running again. Besides that I know a lot of us want to help out with the clean-up effort in the local community. Our office is near Fortitude Valley which has been impacted by the flood, but we're situated on a hill so the office is unaffected. We also haven't been hit by the power cuts.</p>\n<p>I appreciate how lucky we've been that's why I want to help out as much as possible. Our Premier, Anna Bligh, who has been doing a sterling job, says that they need two things: volunteers and money. This couldn't come at a worse time for us if they want money. However, while we're short on cash I have been able to find another way that I can donate. Virgin Blue allows you to cash in your velocity points for cash donations. I've got plenty of those so that's what I've done. The page to make donations from Velocity Points is <a href=\"https://shop.velocityrewards.com.au/Pages/SOR/Browse.aspx?CategoryCode=RELIEF\">here</a> (it's quite hard to find on their website). I've also signed up with Volunteering Queensland. The form for that is <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/formResponse?formkey=dEVtTDQyWUZldUhUUjR6ZFlPWTNWR2c6MQ&amp;ifq\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It's very easy to start a new year and think about personal plans (see my last post). Then something like this comes along and puts it all into perspective. </p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A few years ago on BBC2 in the UK there was a programme called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Gorman\">Dave Gorman's</a> Important Astrology Experiment. I don't know if you watched it but the concept behind the series was that Dave would follow exactly what was recommended for his star sign in a selection of horoscopes, and then see how that affected his happiness. For measuring happiness he used the triad of Love, Health and Wealth.\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/338fb4c105.jpg\" alt=\"happiness-triad.jpg\" align=\"left\" /></p>\n<p>It was a funny series, but the reason I mention it is that I've always thought that using the happiness triad is a really good tool for life planning. If you think about it, most new year's resolutions will fall into one of the three boxes.</p>\n<p>I thought I'd share a few of my plans for 2011 and also look back at how 2010 measured against my own happiness triad.</p>\n<h3>Review of 2010</h3>\n<p>I'll start with last year. For Love, that's got to be a big positive because me and Rach finally tied the knot. Lauren makes me happy every day. All is well in the Haines household on the Love front.</p>\n<p>As for Health, that's been a mixed bag. I had no real health problems last year, with the exception of a few warning signs that it was time to slow down. I managed to lose a few pounds before the wedding, and then proceeded with much fervour to put them straight back on again during the month I had off work for the wedding and honeymoon, and 3 weeks for xmas. </p>\n<p>The warning signs were mainly due to too much drinking. I don't drink a fraction of what I did when I was in the Navy. Maybe that's the problem? In the Navy drinking was pretty much mandatory so my tolerance to it was much greater than it is today. In 2010, I didn't drink that often, but when I did it tended to be binge drinking. I had some really good nights out which involved drinking far more than is good for you, and on a few occasions i started to develop numbness on one side of my face after a drinking session, or during, which isn't a good thing. A kind of Bell's Palsy apparently, according to a nurse friend of ours.</p>\n<p>So on the health front it was a mixed bag. </p>\n<p>Finally there's Wealth. I look at wealth in two ways - financial wealth and wealth of knowledge.</p>\n<p>Financial wealth was going quiet well for most of the year. I've managed to maintain my 4-day a week job while steadily, but not greatly, growing the IPChitChat business. Although I still don't draw a salary from IPChitChat we did make a few payouts for ourselves during 2010 as a return on investment. This meant we were in a lucky position that Rachelle was able to give up her job and come and work from home for the business.</p>\n<p>All was going well with the finances up until the wedding. As much as you plan and budget, it always ends up costing more than you originally planned. And so it proved. Even though it was a relatively cheap wedding by comparison to the standard these days, we've still left ourselves with quite a bit of debt which I'll probably be paying off for the next 2 years! This means that coming into January Rach has started looking for a part-time job again just to help us through this sticky patch. It's funny how there seems to be an inverse relationship between love and wealth when it comes to getting married!</p>\n<p>In terms of wealth of knowledge, I feel that this is where I made the most gain in 2010. I was very lucky to travel quite a bit during 2010 and travel does indeed broaden the mind, even if I did spend most of it in bars! Similarly, I maintain an interest in lots of different subjects and read extensively. I don't know about you but I find as get older my thirst for knowledge increases exponentially. Importantly I learnt an enormous amount that will contribute to growing my business.</p>\n<p>On the business side of things I may look back at 2010 as a year of procrastination. There was no real major achievement but like I said, I did learn a lot. It's amazing how much you learn by doing the wrong things. I spent far too much time during 2010 just trying to get things to work, rather than concentrating on the big picture. I don't know how many hours I lost messing about with technical things that really should be left to someone who knows what they're doing. I've learnt that lesson. At the same time, those hours spent learning the technical side of business will help me in the future. I'll explain more when I discuss plans for 2011 below.</p>\n<p>So all in all not a bad year. Am I happier at the beginning of 2011 then I was in January 2010? I'd say yes, I am.</p>\n<h3>Plans for 2011</h3>\n<p>If we look at the Love side of the happiness triad, well I'm married now so I suppose it's just downhill from here! Just kidding. The emphasis for 2011 needs to be on life-balance. It's very easy to just get obsessed with work and forget that there's other people in my life. Even though I have a job and a separate business, I need to be conscious of the fact that i need to put some time aside as family time.  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, as the saying goes.</p>\n<p>Health, now that's a continuing battle. I know I've probably said this the last 10 years in a row, but this is the year when I get really fit and healthy. Honest. </p>\n<p>Wealth. I spent most of 2010 having my finances under control. My credit card balances were 0 because i paid the balance off in full each month. That was until the wedding. 2011 is going to be a frugal year. I've already made a concerted effort to reduce expenses. The next goal is to increase income, and the way I'm going to do that is through the business.</p>\n<p>I've now launched netcloudsecurity.com which will hopefully contribute something, but that's more out of a response to events. The problem with providing services, of any kind, is that the amount of $ output you get from it is entirely dependant upon the number of hours you put into it. The ultimate goal is surely to create passive income, where you create something that continues to generate revenue without further work from yourself.</p>\n<p>In the next few weeks I'll be launching another website, which will be my main focus of attention for the 2011. This website draws on my experience as a <a href=\"/blog/224/pci-qsa\">PCI QSA</a> and will hopefully be something that will help many businesses and individuals.</p>\n<p>They key business lesson that I've learnt from 2010 that I will apply to this year is that I definitely need to focus on the core activities that generate revenue. As I've said, far too much time was spent in 2010 troubleshooting technical problems and learning new technical skills. For example, I spent many a hour last year building my new PCI site using the Drupal Content Management System (CMS). <a href=\"http://www.drupal.org\">Drupal</a> is a fantastic CRM and in the right hands, can do everything you want it to. To save a bit of money and due to budgetary constraints, I decided to build the entire site myself. Whilst I got the majority of it built I spent hours if not days messing about trying to get some of the basics working, such as displaying my content correctly in RSS feeds.</p>\n<p>Last week I finally gave up on Drupal and the new website will be shortly launching in <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">Wordpress</a>. The Wordpress CRM is great for getting sites up and running very quickly. It perhaps doesn't offer all of the features that Drupal does but who cares, it's content that's important. I realise that now.</p>\n<p>For IPChitChat we had some great success with outsourcing, and we're now at the point where if we want anything doing technically with the website we'll simply outsource it. We've finally found some developers on <a href=\"http://www.elance.com/\">Elance.com</a> that we're really happy with and trust.  The developers we chose are a company in Vietnam. We placed a number of projects on Elance with them last year and because they're a) extremely affordable, b) professional, and c) quick to respond, we'll be using them for the majority of our technical work in 2011.</p>\n<p>You may think that you are saving money by doing it yourself but you're really not. I now follow my own advice that I've spouted many times before - you need to put a price on your time. If it takes you 2 weeks to do a job that an external developer can do in 2 days, is it really saving money to do it yourself?</p>\n<p>As an example, we had 3 jobs that we asked our developers to do last week. They did the entire work in 2 days for a total cost of $175. It would have taken me a week at least. A week of my time is worth far more than $175.</p>\n<p>I said previously that all the lost time in 2010 doing technical work was not entirely mis-spent. This is because having a certain level of knowledge really helps when you outsource work to others. For instance, If I decide to build any new sites in Drupal and outsource the work, I'm confident that I'll be able to draw up detailed specifications for the work, and be able to properly vet what gets delivered. There's also lots of small technical jobs that I'll be able to do quickly myself without having to outsource it.</p>\n<p>In summary, for 2011, the goal is to maintain the Love score, but improve on Health and Wealth.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Looking down my blog at previous blog posts I've noticed that some of the images are no longer showing. I've done some investigation and this seems to be a problem caused by iPhoto.\nI use iPhoto on my Mac to store and manage all my photo's, and then publish them to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/thehainesfamily\">Flickr</a> using the built-in features of iPhoto. If there's a photo that I've published on Flickr which I want to use in my blog, I simply change the permissions of the image on Flickr so that anyone can view it, and then embed the image into the blog post so that my blog pulls the image from Flickr.</p>\n<p>What seems to be happening is that every time I publish new photo's from iPhoto to flickr, some of my previous photo's are also getting re-synchronised. It turns out that every time you make a change to a photo on flickr the URL of the photo also gets changed.  This means that the link in my blog post to the embedded photo no longer works.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there's a way to stop this happening in iPhoto but for now I've decided that in future I'll copy images directly to my blog rather than embedding them from flickr.</p>\n<p>When I get round to it I'll also go back and correct all those missing images in previous posts.</p>\n",

				"title": "My Favourite Films of 2010",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>As is customary this time of year, here's a list of some of my favourites films from 2010. There's no doubt going to be other great films that came out in 2010 which aren't listed here simply because I haven't seen them yet, but these are the ones I have seen and enjoyed the most:</p>\n<h2>1. The Social Network</h2>\n<div id=\"blockleft\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bf85310a3f.jpg\" alt=\"The Social Network (HD).jpg\" align=\"left\" /></div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">My favourite film of the year was easily <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/\">The Social Network</a> - the movie about the founding of Facebook. The beauty of this film is that you don't need to be a Facebook user or even have ever heard of Facebook to enjoy it. The screenplay is written by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815070/\">Aaron Sorkin</a> who wrote <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/\">The West Wing</a> - my all-time favourite TV series, so I was very much looking forward to some fast-paced intelligent, witty dialogue. He didn't disappoint. Right from the opening scene where we are introduced to the brilliant, yet flawed genius that is Mark Zuckerberg, we were treated to some trademark Aaron Sorkin writing.</p>\n<p>Of course, the film isn't exactly accurate. There are many plot points which are contrary to the evidence provided by articles from the time and comments made by the protagonists themselves, yet this doesn't detract from the substance of the film. Like all good semi-biographical films, history is dramatised to make it more interesting. In an <a href=\"http://nymag.com/movies/features/68319/\">interview with the New York Magazine</a>, Aaron Sorkin freely admits that plot details are fabricated. </p>\n<p>You come away from watching The Social Networking thinking that yes, Mark Zuckerberg is a genius, but he's also a bit of a dick. To what extent that is true will only be known by those who know him. But it serves the plot well - focusing on the irony of the world's largest social network being created by someone so lacking in social skills.\n</p></div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<h2>2. Inception</h2>\n<div id=\"blockleft\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a71c9c61ca.jpg\" alt=\"Inception (HD).jpg\" align=\"left\" />\n</div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">\nOk, I admit that like most other people I got a bit lost trying to follow the plot of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/\">Inception</a>. Trying to keep track of whose dream the characters were in, or even dream within a dream, was a major task. I've watched this twice now and even on the second viewing I had to stop the film briefly and refer to the IMDB synopsis so I could figure out what was happening.</p>\n<p>A film that makes you work in this way might put off some people, but it shouldn't. Even if you don't understand what's going on you can still sit back and enjoy what is a remarkable, truly original cinematic experience. Saying that, I actually think I enjoyed it more the second time round watching it on my TV at home than I did in the cinema. The reason for this is that the music was just too damn loud in the cinema. The score for this film is very heavily lathered on from beginning to end, much like it is in The Dark Knight, also directed by Christopher Nolan. Being able to turn the volume down slightly at home on the second viewing made for a much more enjoyable experience.\n</p></div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<h2>3. City Island</H2></p>\n<div id=\"blockleft\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/134a64928e.jpg\" alt=\"City Island (HD).jpg\" align=\"left\" />\n</div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">\nThis is listed as a 2009 release on IMDB but it was a 2010 release for us in Australia. Maybe if movies got released around the world at the same time we might not be so inclined to download them free from torrent sites! It's absolutely rideculous that sometimes films aren't released until a full year after the date of release in the US.  Anyway...</p>\n<p>City Island is very much in the vein of American Beauty, about a dysfunctional family living on City Island - a small island in the New York City borough of the Bronx. This dark comedy starring Andy Garcia is a little gem. I'd never heard of the film before I came across it and had no idea of the plot before watching it. It's really funny and surprising.  Definitely worth a watch.\n</p></div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<h2>4. The Special Relationship</h2>\n<div id=\"blockleft\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/161fcff0fc.jpg\" alt=\"The_Special_Relationship_poster.jpg\" align=\"left\" />\n</div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1117646/\">The Special Relationship</a> is another one where some facts were glossed over and some events were invented for dramatic effect, as with Peter Morgan's other films about Tony Blair: The Deal and The Queen. I watched this shortly after reading Tony Blair's autobiography so it was interesting watching some of the events that TB described in his book play out on screen. I've never been the biggest TB fan and after watching this and reading his book it's very easy to appreciate his political skills and successes, but there's no doubt he's egotistical and likes to tell a few porkies now and then if he thinks the end justifies the means.\n</div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<h2>5. The Ghost Writer</h2>\n<div id=\"blockleft\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://daryl.micro.blog/uploads/2024/914ab6d162.jpg\" alt=\"The Ghost Writer.jpg\" align=\"left\" />\n</div>\n<div id=\"blockright\">\nYou could say <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139328/\">The Ghost Writer</a> is another film about Tony Blair. Robert Harris wrote the screenplay for this film based on his book - The Ghost, and it shows as it pretty much follows the book word for word. Which is a good thing, because the book was very enjoyable.  Even so, it's not often that you can say the film was better than the book, but in this case I think it may well be.\n</div>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" />\n<H2>Honourable Mentions</h2>\n<p>A few other films that I enjoyed this year include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289406/\">Harry Brown</a>. I'm a sucker for a good revenge thriller. Watching a decrepit (Michael Caine) kick the ass of a few hoodies in London makes for 2 very entertaining hours!</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1282140/\">Easy A</a>. Not normally the type of film I'd bother with but after reading some good reviews I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did. Emma Stone in this reminded me very much of Carey Mulligan's performance in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1174732/\">An Education</a> - one of my favourite films from 2009. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1341167/\">Four Lions</a>. A comedy about suicide bombers. That's the way to tackle religious extremists - laugh at their incompetence! Lots of laughs and it was good to see Sheffield and Meadowhall for a bit of nostalgia.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/\">Shutter Island</a>. Leonardo Di Caprio makes some really good choices when it comes to scripts. Here he again teams up with Martin Scorsese for another film which makes you work a little to understand what's going on. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815236/\">She's Out Of My League</a>. I watched this on the plane over to LA. This year hasn't been that great for comedies but this was one of the better ones.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375670/\">Grown Ups</a>. This received a lot of bad reviews but I actually enjoyed it. It certainly passed the laugh test for me. You can tell that it was written by Adam Sandler though. Very indulgent of him to cast his character as the funny guy who's also the hero.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440728/\">The American</a>. Not sure if this belongs here because to tell you the truth I found it a bit boring. On purpose this film is very slow and minimalistic. However George Clooney is always good value and in this he plays a character very similar to that he played in Michael Clayton, which I enjoyed immensely. It was watchable but I'm not in a hurry to watch it again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><H2>I'll Never Get Those Two Hours Back Again</h2>\n<p>Here's a list of some films from 2010 which I assign to the 'what a load of shit' category.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179034/\">From Paris with Love</a>. Far too much style over substance. A disappointing action flick. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1385867/\">Cop Out</a>. I don't think I laughed once. Really lame</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185416/\">When in Rome</a>. Every now and again I have to do the husbandly duty and sit through a chick flick with Rachelle. Some I don't mind and are actually quite good, such as It's Complicated and Julie &amp; Julia. When in Rome however is absolutely dire.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0955308/\">Robin Hood</a>. There's not many Ridley Scott or Russell Crowe films that I don't like. Frankly though, this new incarnation of Robin Hood was just too boring. It took me two sittings to get through it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429493/\">The A Team</a>. Pure sacrilege to make a crap job of a movie out of my childhood Saturday night viewing. Ridiculous and very forgettable</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/\">The Expendables</a>. The concept for this film was much better than the execution. What is it with Sylvester Stallone these days that he likes to revel in gore. Much like John Rambo, the violence was way over the top, even for an action film.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027718/\">Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</a>. The original Wall Street is one of my favourite films. This on the other hand is a snore fest. How very disappointing.</li>\n</ul>\n",
