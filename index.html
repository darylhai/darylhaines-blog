			 <p>TL/DR: not dead yet!</p>
<p>I’ve just had my latest bone marrow biopsy results which show the percent of Leukaemia cells detected in my bone marrow.</p>
<p>A quick recap. In April, after my March biopsy, I was told I was in molecular relapse. The result was 0.5%.</p>
<p>They immediately increased my dosage of Ponatinib to the full dose - 45mg. My doctor explained he expected that Ponatinib may be slowing down the cancer growth but it isn’t stopping it.</p>
<p>Shortly after my last post I got approved for a new drug on clinical trials. This new drug - Asciminib - arrived a couple of weeks ago after this latest bone marrow biopsy was taken. Therefore the latest results reflect the increase in Ponatinib, not the switch to Asciminib.</p>
<p>The latest result shows my Leukaemia is now at 2%.</p>
<p>This is obviously isn&rsquo;t great - a fourfold increase in 8 weeks, but it’s much less than what I was fearing.</p>
<p>In fact, I went back and looked at the results from the December biopsy. That was 0.003%. A rise from 0.003 in December to 0.5 in March represents a 167x increase. If you project that growth forward to today&hellip; well, I’d probably be gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting blood tests every 2 weeks - each time with a sense of dread regarding the white cell count. An increase in the white cell count is an indication that the cancer is no longer consigned to the bone marrow and has now spilled into the bloodstream. This typically happens when the percentage in the bone marrow is above 5-10%, although this is an average -  for some people it&rsquo;s less, for some it&rsquo;s more. When this happens, this is considered hematologic relapse - a tipping point marked by rapid disease growth, a fast breakdown in general health and a heightened risk of spread to the organs.</p>
<p>Each subsequent blood test with a normal white cell count has given me relief, and hope, that it isn&rsquo;t spreading as fast as I feared.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s consigned to the bone marrow, there is still a risk of what&rsquo;s known as sanctuary site spread - progression to the central nervous system and testes. This is not common, but it&rsquo;s not rare either. I need to carefully look out for the symptoms. The problem with this, of course, is that I&rsquo;ve already been experiencing many of the symptoms due to previous treatments and current medication.</p>
<h3 id="asciminib">Asciminib</h3>
<p>Understanding all the terms and different treatments is challenging for us non-medical professionals. At this point, I&rsquo;ve pretty much gone through the full gamut of treatment options, so my knowledge is rapidly improving.</p>
<p>It started with chemotherapy. This targets and kills rapidly dividing cells, but also kills healthy cells. As I was in Australia, I had the Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy protocol - high intensity chemo that resulted in prolonged hospitalisation. If you read my previous posts you know the effects, it wasn&rsquo;t nice. The NHS takes a different approach. If I had been in the UK I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone through all that. Whether the end result would have been different or the same, I&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>I then had a stem cell transplant after returning to the UK. The stem cell transplant attempted to replace my cancerous bone marrow with healthy donor bone marrow. The goal is to get to 100% chimerism - where all donor cells replace my cells. I only ever got to 99%. The tiny amount of residual Leukaemia in that 1% resulted in relapse.</p>
<p>After relapse, I had CAR-T therapy, which is immunotherapy rather than chemotherapy. This is a type of personalised cell therapy where my T-cells were genetically engineered in a lab to recognise and kill cancer cells.</p>
<p>Between chemo and the stem cell transplant, I was given Dasatinib. Following the stem cell transplant I was on Ponatinib. Now I&rsquo;m on Asciminib. This is not chemo or immunotherapy. These are all what&rsquo;s known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).</p>
<p>I have an aggressive form of Leukaemia called Ph+ ALL-B (Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia), which involves an abnormal gene called BCR-ABL1 that causes white blood cells to grow uncontrollably. These three drugs - Dasatinib, Ponatinib, and now Asciminib - all aim to block that gene, but they each work in slightly different ways.</p>
<p>Dasatinib is a 2nd generation TKI that sits in the part of the BCR-ABL protein where ATP (the energy molecule) usually goes. It attempts to block that spot, and by blocking the spot, shut down the growth signal.</p>
<p>Ponatinib is a 3rd generation TKI. It’s designed to still work if the BCR-ABL gene mutates, especially the T315I mutation, which makes many other TKIs stop working. It binds tightly and has been found to work better than Dasatinib for hard-to-treat cases.</p>
<p>Asciminib is the next generation TKI. It works completely different from the others. It’s called a STAMP inhibitor (Specifically Targets the ABL Myristoyl Pocket). Instead of blocking the ATP site, it binds to a hidden “back pocket” on the ABL part of the protein and locks it into an “off” position. This avoids resistance that can develop with the other drugs.</p>
<p>Asciminib has been approved for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients but it is not yet licensed for ALL patients in the UK. I&rsquo;ve been approved for clinical trials on compassionate grounds. At this point there&rsquo;s very little clinical data regarding its efficacy in ALL patients. Ph+ ALL shares the same BCR-ABL1 gene mutation as CML, so in theory Asciminib can work similarly. There&rsquo;s just not much clinical data to support the theory - I&rsquo;m one of the guinea pigs.</p>
<h3 id="limbo">Limbo</h3>
<p>At the moment I feel like I&rsquo;m living in limbo. Time is measured by gaps between blood tests and bone marrow biopsy results. My next bone marrow biopsy will be 8 weeks after I started Asciminib. Based on my own calculations, If the growth rate stays the same, it&rsquo;s also about that time that the cancer could start showing in the blood results. Therefore, if my white cell count is still ok around this time then that may be an indication that Asciminib is working - either slowing the growth further, or in the best case, reversing it. I can but hope. I should get the biopsy results early August, at which point the team have a decision to make about whether to go ahead with donor lymphocytes. I talked about this in my <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2025/04/10/another-relapse-health-update-apr.html">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m just trying to deal with the various side-effects which have changed with each treatment, and concentrate on getting stronger for what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p>The last two months haven&rsquo;t been great. April ended with an unplanned visit to hospital. The constipation got ridiculous, it required extreme measures. It&rsquo;s fair to say I reached a new milestone - the full dose of prescribed laxatives, 8 sachets of Laxidose, three suppositories and two enemas in a 24 hr period. It did the trick, and since then I haven&rsquo;t had any problems in that department.</p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve been having various other side-effects most days to one degree or another. It&rsquo;s nothing I haven&rsquo;t been through before. The main challenge has been in my head.</p>
<p>From the beginning of this nightmare, I&rsquo;ve been pretty strong mentally, but something changed in May. I just lost motivation and everything became a big struggle. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of offers of help. There&rsquo;s no shortage of that available - whether from the hospital or cancer charities. When I was an in-patient I had regular visits from the resident chaplain - whether I wanted it or not.</p>
<p>I know mental support is helpful for a lot of people but it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve personally sought out. I don&rsquo;t see what difference it makes. I know the root causes of my issues. Any mental problems are a direct result of my physical problems. Talking about it with a stranger isn&rsquo;t going to change the underlying facts. I also know that bottling it up isn&rsquo;t helpful. I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s not much else going on in my life at the moment so talking about it with those around me hasn&rsquo;t been a problem. Even this blog is a form of therapy. Except, in May, I guess I did shut down and bottle things up for a while.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m through that phase now and back on the right side. I&rsquo;ll probably slap the next person who tells me to &ldquo;think positive&rdquo;, but besides that, I am getting back to normal - getting out when I can and appreciating the now, rather than worrying about the future. Receiving the latest biopsy result has helped. It&rsquo;s the not knowing that&rsquo;s the hardest.</p>
<p>In 3 weeks I will be 50 years old. There was a time when I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d make it to that milestone. I&rsquo;ll take that as another win.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve been waiting for the results of my latest bone marrow biopsy to confirm that I’m still in remission. The hospital rang me on Monday asking me to go in on Tuesday. I knew this would mean bad news.</p>
<p>Testing confirms that I’m in molecular relapse. What this means is that although I only have a small amount of leukaemia cells, the percentage has increased from the last test, meaning there is no doubt that it is returning. I’m in trouble.</p>
<p>The stem cell transplant didn’t work. The CAR-T therapy didn’t work. They also put me on a drug called Ponatanib. It looks like this is no longer fully working. The way the consultant doctor explained it, he suspects that the Ponatanib is now acting like a handbrake on a Honda Jazz - it may be slowing it down, but be in no doubt, the car crash is coming.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>I’m running out of options. We are now in new territory where they have followed standard protocol but now need to design a specific plan just for me.</p>
<p>The doctor has put in an application for a new next-generation drug that is undergoing clinical trials. It’s not licensed for use in the UK. He is hoping that he can get special approval for me to get it free of charge from the commercial company as part of the clinical trials.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work, the next option is Donor Lymphocytes. When I had the stem cell transplant, they kept back extra donor blood for this scenario. This would involve them taking the lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) and giving me an intravenous injection.</p>
<p>These lymphocytes include T cells, which are powerful parts of the immune system. The goal is for these donor T cells to recognise my leukaemia cells as enemies and attack them. This is called the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect.</p>
<p>Here’s the tricky part. When I had the stem cell transplant I was, and still am, given medication to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD).</p>
<p>Now, the doctor hopes the donor lymphocytes causes mild to moderate GVHD because it’s a sign that GVL is working.</p>
<p>The trick is to hit the sweet spot - to cause enough GVHD, but not too much that GVHD kills me instead of Leukaemia.</p>
<p>I’ll do another post later where I’ll attempt to explain the science, for anyone that’s interested.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-have-i-got">How Long Have I Got?</h3>
<p>It is extremely difficult to get the doctor to give any specific timelines because there are too many variables.</p>
<p>Based on my own research, the following may or may not be accurate.</p>
<p>I’m currently at 0.5%, or at least I was a month ago when tested. This is molecular relapse. This is the percentage of cancerous Leukaemia cells in my bone marrow. It&rsquo;s not considered full relapse until it gets to about 10%.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario - Ponatanib has completely stopped working. I can progress to full-blown relapse in as little as 2-4 weeks. From there, without treatment, my type of Leukaemia (ph+ ALL-B) is very aggressive, death can occur within 1-3 months.</p>
<p>The fact that 4 weeks after my bone marrow biopsy it’s not yet showing up in the blood results gives hope that Ponatanib is slowing it down rather than failed completely. The doctor has immediately increased my dosage in the hope to buy us more time. The actual timeline will then depend on the effectiveness of the proposed treatments.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-i-expect">What Can I Expect?</h3>
<p>If the new drug is approved, common side effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gastrointestinal issues: nausea, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Skin reactions: rash, itching, or dry skin</li>
<li>Increased blood pressure</li>
<li>Musculoskeletal pain</li>
<li>Haematological abnormalities: reductions in certain blood cell counts (like platelets or white blood cells), which may increase the risk of infections or bleeding</li>
</ul>
<p>While less common, more serious side effects like liver enzyme elevations or cardiovascular issues can occur.</p>
<p>Luckily, other than a few gastro issues, I’ve managed to tolerate Ponatanib pretty well, which had the same possible side-effects.</p>
<p>If I do need a donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI), common side effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever and chills</li>
<li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
<li>Infections</li>
<li>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) — much less common than in CAR-T therapy, but possible if a strong immune response happens</li>
<li>Autoimmune reactions — where donor cells start attacking specific organs or systems (rare, but documented)</li>
<li>Acute GVHD:
<ul>
<li>Skin rash (redness, itching, peeling)</li>
<li>Gastrointestinal symptoms:
<ul>
<li>Diarrhoea</li>
<li>Abdominal cramps</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Liver problems:
<ul>
<li>Elevated liver enzymes</li>
<li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chronic GVHD (I’m still at risk of this from last year&rsquo;s stem cell transplant):
<ul>
<li>Skin changes:
<ul>
<li>Thickening, tightening (like scleroderma)</li>
<li>Rash or pigment changes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dry eyes and mouth (like Sjögren’s syndrome)</li>
<li>Hair loss</li>
<li>Joint stiffness or muscle weakness</li>
<li>Lung problems:
<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Bronchiolitis obliterans (a serious lung condition)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gastrointestinal symptoms:
<ul>
<li>Persistent nausea, vomiting</li>
<li>Malabsorption or weight loss</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Liver dysfunction:
<ul>
<li>Chronic hepatitis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Genital issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Less Common GVHD side effects:
<ul>
<li>Esophageal narrowing or difficulty swallowing</li>
<li>Nail changes or loss</li>
<li>Increased risk of infections (due to immunosuppression)</li>
<li>Fatigue and malaise</li>
<li>Peripheral neuropathy</li>
<li>Dry, irritated lungs or airways</li>
<li>Cataracts (especially after high-dose steroids)</li>
<li>Mood changes or depression</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bone marrow suppression
<ul>
<li>Low white cells (infections)</li>
<li>Low platelets (bruising/bleeding)</li>
<li>Low red cells (fatigue, breathlessness).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve already had a lot of this from previous treatment. One silver lining is that I do not need intensive conditioning chemo to wipe out my immune system like I did before the stem cell transplant and CAR-T therapy. I’m not sure I could take any more intensive chemo.</p>
<h3 id="state-of-mind">State of Mind</h3>
<p>If you haven’t been through anything like this you may wonder how I’m taking it. The truth is, I had a moment, but otherwise I’ve quickly moved to acceptance. It&rsquo;s entirely out of my hands. This is now the second time I’ve relapsed. I know I’m not winning the battle, but there’s no point moping about it. I have to think about practicalities, like preparing for the worst.</p>
<p>When I was first diagnosed, but after the initial treatment, we made sure I had a will in place.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, a few months before I was diagnosed, I created an ‘If I Die’ document. At the beginning of 2023 I had this realisation that I’ve been fairly lucky in my life. No major tragedies. I had lost grandparents, but they were at a grand old age. I had never considered  bereavement planning for myself. Yet, I had this weird feeling that something was coming. I’m not religious or spiritual. I really can’t explain it.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;If I Die&rsquo; document is a guide for Rach and Lauren to know exactly what to do so they don&rsquo;t have to panic about the practical steps. It includes things like getting access to finances, life insurance, etc. It includes things they will need, like account details and where to find passwords (we use a <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> family vault for most things). It also includes a short section on funeral arrangements. In my case, I don’t care - I’ll be dead - it’s not about me, it’s about them. The only instruction was to not spend much money.</p>
<p>Since that initial diagnosis, a lot has changed and I need to ensure the document is updated as a priority. A change of country and nearly 2 years without income has a big impact on finances!</p>
<p>In terms of pension, I have my Australian superannuation where I&rsquo;ve already named the beneficiary. I have a small private corporate pension for the few years I worked in the UK. I have a Navy pension for my time in the Navy, and there&rsquo;s the UK state pension. When we first panicked about finances, I looked about getting access to some of this. There was no chance. You either have to reach preservation age or be confirmed as dying. I do now have the necessary paperwork to be able to get access, at least in the UK, but now I don&rsquo;t want to. We have adjusted our circumstances and finally, with help from the state, we can get by on very little. I would rather the full lump-sum go to Rach and Lauren.</p>
<p>I also still need to sort out power of attorney. Another priority.</p>
<p>As well as the practicalities, I’m having to accept that it’s no longer about recovery, the focus is treatment again. Any hopes I had of returning to work this year are out of the window.</p>
<p>This means I’ve had to take some decisions. For one, when I moved back to the UK I set up a business to match the one I had in Australia. I was full of hope that the stem cell transplant would work and I could go back to consulting within 3-6 months. I was also working on a business app that I was going to launch under the business.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’ve had no income from this business, only costs. I’m now going to shut it down. There’s no point incurring these ongoing costs in some hope that I’ll start bringing in income soon. I can think about this again in the future if my treatment is successful.</p>
<p>I also have the dilemma of keeping my professional qualifications. I&rsquo;m now so behind that I need to complete 120 hours continuing professional education (CPE) credits by next March. This is for my Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), I was able to put my Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) in to dormant state (as long as I keep paying the annual fees, at least). If I fail to meet the CPE requirements for my CISSP, it&rsquo;s back to 2003 - studying and sitting a four-hour exam again. The smart move would be to try and complete as many CPEs now as possible before the effects of the next treatments kick-in. The problem is, it&rsquo;s hard to get motivated when (1) it may all be in vain, and (2) even if I make it I have no idea when I&rsquo;ll be able to return to work. At this point, I&rsquo;m even wondering whether I even want to return to cyber security. It could be the opportunity for a new start. Something different.</p>
<p>That something different could be the iPhone app I&rsquo;ve been working on. It was just an idea for doing something completely unrelated to cyber security. After a shaky start, I&rsquo;m beginning to make real progress. Irrespective of how things go, I&rsquo;m going to keep working on it because, more than anything, it&rsquo;s a distraction. While I&rsquo;m concentrating on that I&rsquo;m not thinking about what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h3 id="bucket-list">Bucket List</h3>
<p>You see it in the movies. Someone gets a terminal diagnosis, so spends their final months travelling the world and ticking off items in their bucket list.</p>
<p>The reality is somewhat different. For me at least, I can’t go anywhere. I need to stay close to the hospital, and if treatment fails and it moves to palliative care, I’ll be in no fit state to do anything.</p>
<p>There are a thousand items on my bucket list, but I have no regrets. My life hasn’t been boring. I have a lot to reflect on. That’s why I created <a href="https://weeks.darylhaines.com/">My Life in Weeks</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, less of that. I’m still here and I still have a fighting chance.</p>

			 <p>Apple TV+ has had a pretty good hit rate, so when I saw the trailer it sounded appealing - a cross between Good Will Hunting and Jason Bourne. If only.</p>
<p>The main problem with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31186958/">Prime Target</a> is the central premise. You have to turn off your brain for a lot of these conspiracy / spy shows, but in this case it was made worse because I actually know something about the subject at hand.</p>
<p>The central premise is that a genius mathematician at Cambridge University is on the verge of finding a pattern in prime numbers. Prime numbers are foundational to many cryptographic algorithms, so if a pattern was found, it would pose a significant threat to encrypted data. For this reason, the NSA monitors mathematicians around the world, and those on the verge of making the discovery, well&hellip; you can guess the rest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absurd. Put aside the ridiculousness of a US intelligence agency installing cameras in the offices of mathematicians so they can watch them write out algorithms on a white board. Let&rsquo;s consider the idea that the way to deal with a security vulnerability is to kill the researcher who finds it. It&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s bust a few myths. Companies and marketers like to use terms like &lsquo;military-grade encryption&rsquo; or &lsquo;bank-level security&rsquo;. The fact is, in the case of encryption, there are industry standards. For example, the encryption used to protect the data at rest on your iPhone is no different from the encryption used to protect classified data at rest on a military server.</p>
<p>A common rule in security is that you don&rsquo;t write your own encryption or use some obscure proprietary encryption. It&rsquo;s for one simple reason. Obscurity does not equal security. You want the encryption algorithm to be widely reviewed and tested so you have confidence that it is mathematically and technically sound.</p>
<p>For this reason, most of the world relies on the US National Institute for Standards (NIST). They hold open competitions where cryptographers submit papers and proposals for different cryptographic algorithms. It&rsquo;s an open and transparent process. It&rsquo;s designed that way so that it&rsquo;s open to global academic and industry review, and subject to peer review, like any other science. The transparency builds trust, and it helps standardise the use of encryption algorithms so that systems can inter-operate.</p>
<p>Government wants to know about weaknesses in encryption algorithms. The response is not to try and hide the weakness hoping no one else will find it, or kill the researchers. No, the way they deal with it is by deprecating the algorithm and choosing a better one. It happened when flaws were found in the Data Encryption Standard (DES), so they held competitions to select a cipher for a new standard, which became the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). When you visit a website, the data transmitted between your web browser and the website is encrypted using a different algorithm, which, again, was selected based on merit, and when flaws have been found, NIST updates its standards (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final">FIPS-140</a>) to recommend better ones.</p>
<p>Prime Target could have been more believable (but maybe not so dramatic), if they went with an actual, real threat that is happening right now. The risk to encryption algorithms is not from some genius mathematician - it&rsquo;s from quantum computing.</p>
<p>As we stand in March 2025, NIST is in the final stages of finalising standards for post-quantum cryptography. If all goes well, governments, vendors and organisations across the world will upgrade cryptographic modules in hardware and software to adopt the new standards, and everything will be fine.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&rsquo;s a risk (most likely from China) that a sudden leap will be made in quantum computing and the world will face a Y2K moment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a misconception that the &lsquo;Y2K bug&rsquo; was some kind of damp squib. The media predicted armageddon but in reality nothing happened - therefore it was a lot of fuss and nonsense about nothing.</p>
<p>The truth is that the Y2K bug didn&rsquo;t cause mass disruption because the entire tech industry spent thousands of hours and billions of dollars fixing the problem. I was one of those lucky people who was on-call over the Millennium New Year&rsquo;s Eve and had to go in at stupid-o-clock to make sure everything was working ok.</p>
<p>A sudden advance in quantum computing, without a corresponding quick upgrade to quantum cryptography, could be a major threat. Especially when you combine this with the exponential advances being made in artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>If, for example, it is suddenly revealed that a breakthrough has been made in quantum computing and RSA or elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) was no longer viable for SSL/TLS certificates that protect internet communications, billions of certificates would have to be revoked. It would cause mayhem. Or would it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been through this before. Vulnerabilities were found in SSL and early versions of TLS. The advice was to upgrade. The advice then turned into a mandatory compliance requirement - at least it did for governments, and for merchants wanting to take online payments (contractual requirements to comply with <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org">PCI DSS</a>). There was a transitionary period. No one panicked, and I&rsquo;ve seen no evidence that there were major or widespread security breaches of organisations that were slow to upgrade.</p>
<p>It just goes to show. The risks are real, but we&rsquo;re all - especially in the cyber security industry - terrible at quantifying risk. Plus, even when vulnerabilities are found in cryptographic algorithms, there are usually easier ways of breaching security.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, quantum computing is a risk to encryption. The world will need to adopt post-quantum cryptography sooner or later. For those who care about data security it will be sooner, irrespective of the current state of quantum computing. This is for one reason - the &lsquo;harvest now, decrypt later&rsquo; threat. If you can capture the data now, it might not be readable now, but it could be later if a vulnerability is found or quantum computing breaks the underlying algorithms.</p>
<p>Quantum cryptography is already being rolled out. In February 2024, Apple announced a post-quantum cryptographic protocol (PQ3) for iMessage. Other vendors have also made upgrades, including IBM, Cloudflare, and Signal.</p>
<p>As an aside, Signal has been in the news recently after stupid Trump MAGA morons tried to convince us that those messages on a Signal chat thread didn&rsquo;t include classified information. As someone who has worked on an aircraft carrier processing signals about missions and flight operations, I can attest that that kind of detail would have been highly classified, and I would have been subject to court martial and probably sent to military prison if I had disclosed it.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, just in the last days, the <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/setting-direction-uk-migration-to-pqc">National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has published a roadmap</a> for agencies and organisations to upgrade vital services by 2028 with a full transition to post-quantum cryptography by 2035.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting off-track. This post was meant to be a review of Prime Target.</p>
<p>In general, it&rsquo;s nonsense. Even if you disengage your brain, it&rsquo;s mildly entertaining, at best.</p>
<p>It stars Leo Woodall, who seems to be in everything at the moment. I&rsquo;m not quite sure why he&rsquo;s having the moment that he is. It&rsquo;s never clearly stated in Prime Target, but his character appears to be written with that old trope that he&rsquo;s a genius, so he&rsquo;s &lsquo;on the spectrum&rsquo;. Maybe Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome or something like that. He&rsquo;s clever, but he doesn&rsquo;t recognise social cues. We&rsquo;ve seen it all before. In this case the character is just - bland. I&rsquo;m not sure whether it&rsquo;s the writing, or Leo Woodall&rsquo;s acting. Either way, he&rsquo;s no Matt Damon.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a few bloggers do this so I thought it would be an interesting personal project, particularly given the amount of time I have for reflection given my current circumstances.</p>
<p>Introducing - <a href="https://weeks.darylhaines.com">My Life in Weeks</a>.</p>
<p>The project is inspired by <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">Life in Weeks at Wait But Why</a>. I adapted <a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/life-in-weeks">the code that generated the project</a> from  <a href="https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/life-in-weeks">Gina Trapani</a>, which itself is a fork of code from <a href="https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks">Buster Benson</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting exercise going back and seeing what I can actually find regarding dates for major events in my life. Since 2000, I have a digital record of most things, whether that be emails, calendar events or time-stamped photographs. Prior to 2000, however, it&rsquo;s a little more tricky.</p>
<p>For instance, I&rsquo;m really struggling to recall and find dates for places I visited when I was in the Navy in the 90s. I&rsquo;ve added some events - pieced together from postcards I sent to my parents and a few photos I do have, but I&rsquo;m missing far more than I&rsquo;ve added. A deployment in late 1997 is well-photographed. Other than that, I tended to lose my camera on crazy nights out. I remember one time I lost my camera in the sea when stepping drunkenly from a boat on to the jetty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also struggled to find any official records of port visits for the Royal Navy ships I was on. I can&rsquo;t imagine why this would still be classified. It would take a lot more digging I think. A lot of archived newspaper clippings are behind paywalls. I&rsquo;ll probably need to reach out to former shipmates, or trawl through the various Facebook groups.</p>
<p>My Life in Weeks includes where I lived (I&rsquo;ve moved house a lot), where I&rsquo;ve worked and major trips, in cases where I have dates. I&rsquo;m still missing some holidays from the 90s. I haven&rsquo;t bothered with weekends away. There were a lot of them - when we were in Australia, at least.</p>
<p>You may wonder how much it costs to create and host this little project. The answer is - nothing. The website is published on Netlify, which offer a free plan for personal use. The code is served from a personal GitHub repository - again free. The web server and code is open-source (i.e. free). Ok, you do need to purchase a domain name, but I already had darylhaines.com. For this project I simply created a sub-domain (CNAME) entry with my DNS provider. Easy peasy. Any time I want to update the entires, I simply make a change to a text file, push it using Git to my code repository. Netlify is set up to monitor the repository and automatically publish any changes. If only everything was this easy.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently listened to a podcast episode of The Headliners with Nihal Arthanayaka in which he interviewed Gary Stevenson. I’d never heard of Gary Stevenson before moving to the UK. Gary had a lot to say about wealth inequality, which was interesting, but I was left with a lot of questions. I know this isn&rsquo;t BBC Radio 4, but I would have thought at least Nihal would ask a few probing questions and challenge him on some of the details. No. It was a really poor interview.</p>
<p>It got me interested though. It led me to read Gary Stevenson&rsquo;s book - <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593727232">The Trading Game: A Confession</a>. <strong>★★★★★</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whatever you think about Gary&rsquo;s interview style and social media prophesizing, I found the book fascinating.</p>
<p>Trading Game is not really about wealth inequality. It&rsquo;s mentioned, more towards the end, but the crux of the book is a personal biography of his journey as a poor kid from East London, to the ivory towers of Canary Wharf as a city trader (via the London School of Economics), and his gradual realisation that we&rsquo;re all getting screwed by the ultra-rich.</p>
<p>He talks with real conviction about how he made himself millions by betting on a large increase in economic inequality, and that growing poverty would cause interest rates to stay low, despite the predictions from Government, The Bank of England and leading economists who all said, year after year, that normal levels of interest rates would come back.</p>
<p>I think this is the first book I&rsquo;ve read in a single day. No skim-reading. I read the full book in one day (I got nothing else done that day).</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t put it down. It&rsquo;s an incredible insight into that life. Think Wall Street or The Big Short but relocated to London. More than that, when he becomes disillusioned and decides to leave, it&rsquo;s more like a thriller. It doesn&rsquo;t read well for Citibank - I got the picture that it&rsquo;s easier to leave the mafia than this global bank.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say much more because this is one of those books where you really do get <a href="https://youtu.be/7XA_NVn7XnE?si=Df7IpO697dvsxNfH">the pleasure of finding things out</a>.</p>
<h2 id="wealth-inequality">Wealth Inequality</h2>
<p>In general, I buy the key argument about wealth inequality and the need to tax wealth, not work, but I have a few issues with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@garyseconomics">his YouTube channel</a> and the interviews I&rsquo;ve heard so far.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s successfully getting the message out there that there has been a massive increase in wealth inequality in the last three decades particularly. When he talks about how the 2008 financial crisis and COVID exacerbated the shift of assets from the middle class to the ultra wealthy, I get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a few books on economics lately - trying to get my head around some of the basic economic theory. Gary is inspired by economists such as Thomas Piketty, who popularised the &ldquo;r &gt; g&rdquo; argument in his book <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18736925-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a></em>.</p>
<p>The “r &gt; g” argument refers to the idea that when the rate of return on capital (r) exceeds the rate of economic growth (g), wealth tends to concentrate over time. In other words, if the income generated by investments (like dividends, rents, interest, and capital gains) grows faster than the overall economy and wages, those who already hold capital (typically the wealthy) will see their wealth grow disproportionately. This dynamic can lead to rising inequality unless offset by policies like progressive taxation, especially on capital and wealth.</p>
<p>Gary&rsquo;s solution, in general, is to place a 1% tax on unrealised gains from those worth more than £10 million. After that, he&rsquo;s a bit hazy on the specifics. This is where the main problem lies.</p>
<p>I’m really interested, but I need to hear the counter-arguments and practical solutions. How do you prevent a wealth tax resulting in capital flight, or the risk of less foreign investment? Does he agree with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer Curve</a>? What’s his answer to the French experience of a wealth tax, which ultimately failed? If part of the solution is taxing capital gains at the same rate as income, how do you change capital gains tax without it adversely impacting the middle class?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an economist, so he knows the arguments. He just chooses not to go into details, because, I think, he has this view that it&rsquo;s more important to start with the general message, and maybe us mere mortals are too thick to understand economic theory. It&rsquo;s a little patronising.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched and listened to him being interviewed on various channels. These interviews are also mainly patronising - not delving into the academic arguments or challenging him in anyway.</p>
<p>This is part of the problem. He has become a darling of the left, so most of the interviews so far have been from left-wing broadcasters such as The Guardian, Novara Media, James O&rsquo;Brien, etc,. He has been shouting into the echo chamber. If his campaign is going to work, he needs to reach a broader audience. I&rsquo;d love to see him get interviewed by Andrew Neil on Times Radio. He did get challenged on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03lydX8XHF4&amp;t=3410s">the Piers Morgan show</a>, but the problem with Piers Morgan is the format. It&rsquo;s no place for a proper, nuanced debate. Piers is more interested in getting guests into a shouting match, and in this case he countered Gary with the loon that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Rubin">Dave Rubin</a> .</p>
<p>If he starts aligning himself with the likes of Novara Media - actual supporters of communism, he&rsquo;s got no chance of winning over the vast majority, including me.</p>
<p>Another issue is his presentation style. If you read the book, he reaches a moment where he takes a &lsquo;fuck-it&rsquo; attitude and starts coming in to work in just a hoodie and trackie bottoms. He&rsquo;s now made that part of his identity. He obviously wants to give the impression that he&rsquo;s still just this working class kid from the east of London, not the multi-millionaire that he became. I generally think people should wear what they want, but I can understand why he might not get invited on certain shows. He also swears, a lot.</p>
<p>Anyway, even if you&rsquo;re not interesting in economics, I highly recommend The Trading Game. It&rsquo;s a page-turner!</p>

			 <p>I’m just not jelling with Sean Baker films. The story is enough that it kept me watching to see where it would go, but it’s not enough. The problem is a lack of likeable characters. Are we supposed to empathise with Anora? Even at the end?</p>
<p>Being broken may explain bad choices. It doesn’t excuse them.</p>
<p>Sean Baker gets praised for his realistic portrayal of the lesser-shown sides of humanity. I get it. Yes, it’s gritty and raw. It’s also just a bunch of foul-mouthed characters that I didn’t particularly care about.</p>
<p>Some are describing Anora as a comedy. I struggled to find the humour in a woman being treated like that.</p>
<p>Things have gone seriously wrong if this is what’s considered Oscar-worthy these days.</p>
<p>Also, a Russian that acts like a human being. I&rsquo;m not buying it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Searching for a job is frustrating. There are multiple job platforms, which means you may end up with a flood of emails from each with job listings based on your search criteria. Often these will display the same jobs. Also often, those jobs will be repeated in job listing emails day after day until the job is no longer available.</p>
<p>What if there was one platform that pulled in all the job listings from all these platforms? And what if you could use a simple swipe-right or swipe-left action to dismiss the listing or add it as a job of interest? Maybe then, once the job is dismissed, some smart tech could ensure you don&rsquo;t see that job again in future listings?</p>
<p>That was an idea I pursued for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>When pulling in data from other sites, the most common techniques are APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or web scraping.</p>
<p>In the case of APIs, it relies on 1) the job listing site to have an accessible API that can be used by third parties, and 2) it being free, or affordable enough to make it a worthwhile endeavour.</p>
<p>In the case of job listings on LinkedIn, for instance, the API favours job postings, rather than job retrieval or job queries. This is for one simple reason - all the large platforms are slowly becoming walled gardens. They&rsquo;re making it increasingly difficulty to use the web in the way it was first intended by Tim Berners-Lee. Instead of the open web, we now have a handful of massive tech companies competing for your eyeballs and advertising dollars. If you click on a link in these platforms, it will often open an in-app browser, sometimes with no option to open the link outside of the app in your own browser. These platforms wants to keep you in their walled garden because that&rsquo;s how they make money. This is fair enough - they&rsquo;re not a charity - but it clearly benefits them more than the user.</p>
<p>The other way of pulling data is web-scraping. The problem with this is it&rsquo;s legally dubious, at best. It almost certainly breaks the terms and conditions of the platform, and if you attempt to commercialise that data in any way, you will probably end up with a cease and desist letter from a highly paid lawyer.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you&rsquo;re already a massive tech company and have essentially scraped the entire web to use for your AI models.</p>
<p>This is where we may have a future answer - AI, and specifically - agentic AI.</p>
<p>Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of perceiving their environment, making autonomous decisions, and taking actions without human intervention.</p>
<p>The idea is, with a simple text prompt, you can ask AI to perform computer-based tasks on your behalf while you go off and do something more interesting.</p>
<p>OpenAI ChatGPT has demonstrated this with &lsquo;Operator&rsquo;. Microsoft has introduced agents for Co-Pilot. Claude AI (Anthropic) has &lsquo;computer use&rsquo;, and Google has unveiled Project Mariner. Smaller players are also producing demos of similar advances every week.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how these demonstrations typically go:</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re researching your next trip. With a simple prompt, you tell AI roughly where and when you want to go, your budget, the kind of things you like to do, etc,. It then autonomously opens a bunch of web browser windows and starts doing the searches for you, and pulls the results into a nicely summarised report with recommendations. You could event prompt it to go ahead and make all the bookings for you. I must have spent months of my life doing travel planning manually, so I can easily understand the appeal of handing this over to AI - an autonomous travel agent.</p>
<p>When you first see it, it&rsquo;s creepy as hell. The biggest barrier to this taking off is clearly going to be trust. I&rsquo;m certainly not yet ready to give control of my computer over to AI. I know a lot of early adopters are experimenting with it. I&rsquo;m being a bit more cautious.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s coming, and this could solve the job search issue I described earlier.</p>
<p>I foresee a solution where, in the first instance, you hand over control of your email inbox to AI. Again, this is not the future, it&rsquo;s already happening. You ask AI to summarise new job listings that match your criteria, AI then take those listings and add them to a list in another application, which could be simply in a notes app. You then review the listings and delete any you&rsquo;re not interested in. The AI takes note of what you&rsquo;ve deleted and ensures they&rsquo;re omitted from any future summaries from your email inbox.</p>
<p>This is a fairly simple use case.</p>
<p>The thing about agentic AI is it gets around the web-scraping and AI issue. You can even take out email entirely, and just rely on searching the platforms directly. When prompting the AI, you can give it credentials to log in to LinkedIn as you. The same goes for Indeed, Monster or whatever is your job search platform of choice.</p>
<p>The question is, what will the platforms do to stop this? Is there anything they can do? If the platform owns the agentic AI solution you&rsquo;re using, they&rsquo;re unlikely to object. As for the others, it will be interesting to see what happens.</p>
<p>I know that there are many, like me, that are longing for the death of Google. The &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be evil&rsquo; mission statement was ditched a long time ago at the alter of pure greed. The result is that Google Search, as a product, is absolutely trash. I stopped using it a long time ago because of privacy concerns. When I look at it now, I don&rsquo;t see the best search results at the top. In fact, you have to go &lsquo;below the fold&rsquo; to get organic search results (results that aren&rsquo;t paid for by advertisers). They have ruined their own market-leading product.</p>
<p>Just last week, the co-founder of Google - Sergey Brin, sent out an internal memo saying that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sergey-brin-googlers-about-60-hour-weeks-boost-productivity-risks-2025-3?utm_source=chatgpt.com">AI engineers should work 60-hours per week to hit the productivity &lsquo;sweet spot&rsquo;</a>. So engineers are expected to work long hours, to create a system that will potentially replace their own job, so that the giant corporation can maintain their huge margins. Capitalism at its finest!</p>
<p>Google was a leader in AI. They purchased the British company Deep Mind who was at the forefront of this stuff. Google Deep Mind is doing great things, yet Alphabet (the parent company), still makes most of its money from Google Search&rsquo;s targeted advertising. Google still has massive market dominance in search. That currently remains at 90% of the global search market. Only a company with a such a monopoly would actively go out of their way to make their product worse for users.</p>
<p>Things are starting to change. For many of us, Google is no longer the first stop for searching the web. I now use AI. Sooner or later, everyone else will. Google is trying to counter this by integrating AI into Google Search, such as with AI Overviews. It may be too late. Once the masses understand the utility of AI, they will gravitate to AI-first search. That could be Google, but they&rsquo;re no longer the only player in town.</p>
<p>It has been revealed in anti-trust lawsuits that Google paid Apple as much as $20 billion to be the default search engine on the iPhone. Yet, if you buy an iPhone now, Apple markets &lsquo;Apple Intelligence&rsquo;. The deal they have done to make up for the limitations in Siri is not with Google, it&rsquo;s with OpenAI. They have said that they may support other AI providers later, but you have to wonder if Google has missed their opportunity to be the market leader in AI. I really hope so.</p>
<p>Google have already discovered in their experiments with AI Overviews that the summary is often good enough so that users will not click on a link to take them through to the source website. If you&rsquo;re a company paying for a prominent link in Google, what&rsquo;s the value in paying any longer if you&rsquo;re not getting the click-through to your own site? It&rsquo;s a problem for Google, and it&rsquo;s a problem for advertisers.</p>
<p>This is where the big AI platforms may also become their own walled gardens. You currently only get live web search on a paid plan in OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT. Your search includes links to the source articles, but if all you are looking for is information, nine times out of 10 there may be no incentive to click and review the entire source article. This is a big problem for website owners everywhere.</p>
<p>Some websites are already going as far as adding known AI web crawlers to the robots.txt file on their website to block them. Not that it always works. Some of the major AI players have already been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/">accused of ignoring the robots.txt file</a>. The file is a convention for web technology that crawlers are supposed to abide by - it&rsquo;s not a real preventative measure to actively block or allow web crawlers.</p>
<p>Besides the possibility of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65452940">destroying humanity</a>, AI is another advancement where it&rsquo;s in the balance whether it will advance the open web, or further entrench the power of the tech oligarchs.</p>
<p>For anyone reading my post in the walled-garden that is Facebook, please, take a stand. There are <a href="https://darylhaines.com/subscribe/">other options</a>.</p>

			 <p>My <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2025/02/11/blockout-out-the-noise.html">news blackout</a> didn&rsquo;t last long. Like many, I was outraged by the shit-show that took place in the White House Oval Office last Friday. The bullying and intimidation of President Zelensky by Trump and Vance was horrific. The last time I was this angry from watching the news was when Russia hit the maternity hospital in Mariupol on the 9th of March 2022 (these two things have made me remember - I once wrote a short post about <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2019/03/15/the-ides-of.html">The Ides of March</a>).</p>
<p>It all got me thinking - what can we do as individuals to push back?</p>
<p>Over the weekend, European leaders made all the right noises in support of Ukraine and even backed this up with some real financial commitment.</p>
<p>I fear it’s not enough. The modest increase in defence budgets pale in comparison to what Russia is spending, especially when you take into account purchasing-power parity. The UK commitment of 5,000 lightweight multi-role missiles (LMM) is better than nothing, but in reality, it will perhaps cover Ukraine for a few weeks' defence against Shahed drone attacks. They will be useless against ballistic missile attacks.</p>
<p>Now, the situation is compounded by Trump suspending military aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>He has also commenced the first stage of his trade war, supposedly putting America first by shitting on everyone else, including allies and American consumers.</p>
<p>Can this be a moment for Europe to get its act together? Fill the gap in support for Ukraine and build an industrial base that offers an alternative to US hegemony? I’m skeptical.</p>
<p>Back to the question - what can we do as individuals?</p>
<p>One obvious answer is that we can divest from America. We know from the first term that Trump&rsquo;s primary objective and metric for success is growth in the US stock market and the enrichment of himself and his billionaire backers.</p>
<p>This gave me an idea. What if I were to create a website that informs users about US companies and brands and suggests alternatives? Instead of just pulling information from Wikipedia and other sources, it could use AI-backed search and suggestions.</p>
<p>I would need to &lsquo;eat my own dog food,’ which means spending no money on a tech stack that involves US companies. That means no US-owned domain registrars. No US-owned web hosts. No US AI models, and of course, it would be hypocritical to use Chinese AI models. It should also not rely on any other US technology components that could require payments to scale the website - databases, caches, code repositories, etc.</p>
<p>Then, I may need to market it, but that means no Google, no Facebook, X, Instagram, or Threads. Again, no TikTok because of the Chinese factor.</p>
<p>If I eventually choose to monetise it in some way, it would need to offer customers a way to pay without involving US payment processors. That means no Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Google Pay, Apple Pay, or PayPal.</p>
<p>You see the problem here.</p>
<p>What if, personally, I take a stand? Move away from US services and technology? Shop for groceries and other goods, omitting US-owned brands?</p>
<p>Easier said than done.</p>
<p>Putting aside the lack of viable alternatives for many of these things, there’s also the little issue of cost.</p>
<p>This brought me to the conclusion - ethical consumption is a middle-class privilege. One I can’t currently afford to entertain, at least not in its entirety.</p>
<p>Ethical consumption, just like ethical investing, is complicated.</p>
<p>You could decide to boycott US fast-food chains such as McDonalds. The problem here is that most of these are franchises. You’re not just impacting the US behemoth, you’re also impacting UK owners and employees, who bought the franchise or were employed before the US decided to take this turn.</p>
<p>When purchasing a car, appliance, or buying insurance, you could decide that some of the big German companies may offer viable alternatives. But then you remember that Allianz provided insurance for concentration camps, Mercedes-Benz provided the Nazi elite with bulletproof cars, Siemens employed more than 80,000 slave labourers, and Hugo Boss designed the SS uniforms. These companies acknowledge their history. Some justify that they had no choice - they were only protecting their staff and shareholders. But still&hellip;</p>
<p>Boycotts and cancel culture can work, but they can also have repercussions. Nothing is simple. The international boycott of South Africa played a significant role in ending the apartheid system, but it wasn&rsquo;t the sole factor. It also required leadership changes, shifts in geopolitics, and internal resistance within South Africa.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-the-us-heroes">Where are the U.S. Heroes?</h2>
<p>Is history repeating, or have today’s industrialists not learned the lessons of the past? There have been huge advances in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in recent years, mainly as a result of legal action and activist shareholders. So far, I’m struggling to list the American businesses and billionaires that are taking a stand in support of Ukraine. Plenty are moaning about tariffs, which makes sense, but what about Ukraine and the march to authoritarianism? I guess self-interest trumps everything.</p>
<p>I used to think, naively, that whatever happens in America, the US Constitution means that it can’t turn into Nazi Germany. Yet, we now have a situation where the American people have elected a president who doesn’t believe in the Constitution, backed by a US Congress that refuses to hold him accountable, and a US Supreme Court that cherry-picks and interprets the Constitution based on their political biases.</p>
<p>The Weimar Republic failed in Germany because it was a new experiment with democracy. Germany lacked the historical depth of democratic institutions. This, compounded with the Armistice Treaty and the Great Depression, fostered the environment that allowed Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist Party to get democratically elected. Yet to get there, he also needed financing. There would have been no Führer without backing from rich businessmen, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hugenberg">Alfred Hugenberg</a>.</p>
<p>I recently watched the excellent Apple TV+ series - <a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/vietnam-the-war-that-changed-america/umc.cmc.5louo8zb5eb7zs0dgk06tnk22">Vietnam: The War That Changed America</a>. The last episode featured a businessman who did stand up and do something.</p>
<p>In the dying days of the Vietnam War, when American troops had pulled out, and the North Vietnamese Army was marching on Saigon, the American businessman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Daly">Ed Daly</a>, who was horrified that America would let down an ally, organised humanitarian evacuation flights to rescue South Vietnamese civilians.</p>
<p>In the same episode, I also learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Chambers">Larry Chambers</a>, who, while in command of USS Midway, defied orders and risked a court-martial in order to save the lives of Republic of Vietnam Air Force Major Buang-Ly and his family. Buang-Ly was circling USS Midway in a Cessna light aircraft, but there was nowhere to land on the cramped carrier deck. Larry Chambers gave the order to push overboard millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of Huey helicopters to clear room.</p>
<p>The chaotic scenes in the last days of the Vietnam War would be repeated when America fled from the Taliban in Afghanistan 46 years later.</p>
<p>Less than a year before the evacuation of American civilians and &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; Vietnamese from Saigon, Richard Nixon, facing conviction for abuse of power, was forced to resign as President. What would it take for this Congress to stand up to Trump? I dread to think.</p>
<p>History doesn&rsquo;t repeat, it rhymes. So they say.</p>

		<a href="https://darylhaines.com/2025/02/18/health-update-feb.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-18 13:54:38 &#43;0100">Feb 18, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://darylhaines.com/2024/11/09/health-update-nov.html">In my last update</a> in November, I talked about how I was feeling good, and felt positive about my recovery. I spoke too soon.</p>
<p>Another bone marrow biopsy in December, thankfully, was MRD negative confirming I’m still in remission. That’s the main thing. Otherwise, the last quarter has been setback after setback.</p>
<p>In early December, my blood levels were still up and down. This is normal after CAR-T Therapy. The haematology team decided I needed a boost, so they increased the G-CFS injections to stimulate white blood cell growth, specifically neutrophils. I didn’t react well. I normally get back pain the following day, but the increase left me in constant severe pain. So, it was back on the strong painkillers - and back to the inevitable constipation. They also increased the dosage of daily oral chemotherapy. My body didn’t react well.</p>
<p>The team dropped the injections and chemo back down, but I then had a flare up of pain in my side. I assumed it was kidney stones again. I’ve had kidney stones for years, despite generally following all the dietary recommendations.</p>
<p>The one benefit of being a leukaemia patient is I don’t have to deal with NHS waiting lists. I had a scan straight away and the urologist confirmed what I already knew - small stones in the left kidney and scarring on the right kidney. I had scans every year in Australia and the situation hasn’t changed for about 5 years. Until the stones pass, I have to accept that every now and again, they will move around, causing pain. Medical intervention is too dangerous given my current condition, so I have to hope they don’t grow - or, better still, pass through me without any problems. The medical advice: drink lots of water and follow a low-protein diet (despite protein being good for my muscle recovery).</p>
<p>In mid-December, both Rach and Lauren were sick, so I was isolating in the bedroom. I’ve spent so much time in hospital since initial diagnosis I do everything I can to avoid another stay.</p>
<p>The isolation didn’t work. I picked up the respiratory infection RSV just before Christmas. RSV is doing the rounds, but given I have a compromised immune system, I was worried I would end up in hospital for the Christmas period. Luckily, the RSV never progressed beyond the usual symptoms, and I could stay at home. When you’re immunocompromised, it’s very easy for a simple infection to turn into something like pneumonia and a stay in ICU. The consultants remind me that I’ve been very lucky to avoid ICU so far, given everything I’ve been through.</p>
<p>I just got over RSV in mid-January in time for us to help <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2025/01/20/empty-nest.html">Lauren move to London</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as I returned, I had a flare up of stomach pain. This subsided on the third day, so I didn’t think much of it. I thought it might just be down to eating out for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, it happened again, and there was no obvious trigger. This time, by the third day, the pain was only getting worse. We rang the CAR-T team, who asked me to go in for tests. Blood tests showed heightened infection markers. I was immediately admitted. Yet again, another hospital stay.</p>
<p>After a couple of days the pain subsided. A CT scan showed an inflamed bowel. I have no idea what caused it, neither do the experts. They then decided it likely wasn’t an infection, so they discharged me.</p>
<p>The thing is, I’m still on a load of medication to deal with the chemo, stem cell transplant and CAR-T therapy side-effects. Diagnosing a specific cause of any of the symptoms is a tricky business.</p>
<p>February 9th marked the 1-year anniversary of <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2024/02/08/transplant-day-and.html">my stem cell transplant</a>. This is normally a major milestone - year one for my immune system. Except, of course, it didn’t work. I <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2024/08/21/transplant-failed-what.html">relapsed</a>. Conditioning chemo for the CAR-T therapy wiped my immune system yet again. Despite this, it’s still a milestone. I <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2024/02/01/leukaemia-an-update.html">vividly remember that conversation with the head of the transplant team</a>. I was given a 1 in 5 chance of dying in the first year if I didn’t have the transplant. With the transplant, serious health complications are still common. Well, it has been a year. Im still here and my organs are relatively intact. I’m still at risk of graft versus host disease but the risk should now be lower. I also still find it amazing that I’ve got a different blood type and blood DNA.</p>
<p>It’s now mid-Feb and I’m finally back on track. I’ve restarted the vaccination program, yet again. I’ve now had the first COVID jab three times. The childhood vaccinations are yet to come.</p>
<p>The setbacks mean my physical fitness is no better than a year ago. I’m working on it. The docs want to increase my chemo again. I’m anticipating more side effects.</p>
<p>I continue to hope for a full recovery and a return to work sooner rather than later. This time, however, I’m more realistic about target dates. I keep being told it’s still early days. When this thing started I hoped for the best case - 6 months and back to work.</p>
<p>It has now been 19 months.</p>

			 <p>There’s a lot of news about at the moment. It’s early in Trump’s second term so the media seems to be doing a running commentary on everything he says and does. Fair enough, he purposely says stuff to stir the pot - knowing it’s going to be headline news 5 minutes later.</p>
<p>It can be easy to get in to the habit of constantly doomscrolling, or at least checking in 30 times a day to hear the latest bit of craziness.</p>
<p>I was a sucker for this in his first term. In fact, I’ve been a news junkie ever since 9/11.</p>
<p>However, for a while now, I’ve been consciously trying to unplug.</p>
<p>I’ve realised I don’t need to feel informed about everything in the news. I’ve got no plans to appear on a TV quiz show, and being informed doesn’t add to happiness. In fact, it does the exact opposite. News is invariably bad news.</p>
<p>When it’s not bad news, it’s probably fake news.</p>
<p>In the case of Donald Trump, the constant stream of consciousness is a deliberate strategy to keep himself in the news and deliberately confound and confuse.</p>
<p>His former adviser Steve Bannon famously explained this as the Spray-Tan Sultan’s strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact is, 99% of the news is not going to affect your life in one little bit, unless you let it.</p>
<p>If it’s something big, like a war or recession, you’ll know about it soon enough anyway, even if you don’t follow the day to day noise.</p>
<p>I have this constant battle. The Ukraine war started and I was glued to every single development. It’s only recently that I’ve settled on a system that keeps me in touch with how Ukraine is doing, without being obsessed.</p>
<p>The same happened since Trump has been re-elected. It’s hard not to get sucked back in.</p>
<p>Here’s what I do now. I track my time and concentrate on productive activities. I purposely limit non-productive activities.</p>
<p>When it comes to this, I’m no guru. When my ongoing health problems are a factor I give myself a break. It’s still too early for me to return to work, and some days I don’t have the energy or motivation for anything productive. I used to feel guilty about this, like I was failing in my recovery somehow, or not trying hard enough.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I’m currently at the point when those days are fewer. I know I could have yet another setback so I’m making the most of the good days.</p>
<p>I have a major project that I’m working on with my wife. It consumes my time. It’s cerebral and it’s definitely productive. It may turn into nothing. Even if it does, every failed project is a learning experience.</p>
<p>The next thing is having a healthy balance between producing and consuming. It may feel like ticking off 5 items on your TV/Movie watchlist is an achievement. I suppose it can be, depending on what you watch, but when you look back on your life it’s probably not going to be a highlight.</p>
<p>My Letterboxd watchlist is constantly shouting at me. It’s an easy option but I now try and balance this by reading books for my non-productive time.</p>
<p>I read a lot of non-fiction so is this productive or non-productive time? I suppose it depends on what I do with that knowledge. Some books give me inspiration. Others just feel like an accomplishment in their own right. I generally don’t get this feeling from watching TV or spending an hour scrolling social media or playing a game.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t discount fiction. I don&rsquo;t read as much fiction as I used to but it&rsquo;s still time well spent, even if it&rsquo;s not productive. Escaping in to fiction can have its own benefits. It stimulates the neurons and improves creativity. It has been shown to reduce stress and improve mental well-being. A well-written book can improve language and communications skills. Both fiction and non-fiction can be inspirational, leading you to make positive changes in your life. When I think of this I think back to the year I read &lsquo;Yes Man&rsquo; by Danny Wallace. You can read <a href="https://darylandrach.blogspot.com/2007/03/high-on-life.html">my thoughts on this back in 2007 in a previous incarnation of this blog.</a> The book was truly inspirational. I can&rsquo;t say the same about <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/yes-man/">the Jim Carrey film.</a></p>
<p>Some may argue that gaming is actually productive. I’ve read studies that suggest gaming can lower the risk of dementia in older age. Besides the odd Wordle or Sudoku, I don’t have the patience for gaming.</p>
<p>Some may also argue that social media can be productive. I certainly use it as a resource. The trick is to curate your feed to only include resourceful content. For instance, I’m currently interested in AI and constantly looking at ways I can apply AI to every-day tasks. A lot of what I’ve learnt has come from social media. The problem, of course, is that most platforms try and serve us ‘content you may like’, not just content from trusted sources you follow. It’s getting harder and harder to open an app without being distracted by some nonsense.</p>
<p>I definitely class writing as productive time. Take this blog for instance. It serves no purpose other than for the joy of producing something. I don’t care if nobody reads it. I haven’t turned on analytics. I haven’t even turned on comments. It’s just an outlet, not an asynchronous conversation. Those who do read it may think it’s mostly drivel. They’re probably right. I’m not a journalist. I have no plans to monetise it or post on a regular schedule to feed the beast.</p>
<p>Productivity in itself has long been an obsession. I dread to think how much time and money I’ve spent over the years switching from one productivity app to another. I could write a book on this stuff.</p>
<p>Fatigue and financial necessity now means I keep it simple.</p>
<p>I might write about my productivity ‘journey’ and what I’ve settled on at the moment.</p>
<p>For now, I’ll finish with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is: what are we busy about?”
– Henry David Thoreau</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>There were a couple of things I&rsquo;ve read this week that only added to my disdain of Google.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy081nqx2zjo?at_link_id=9C240522-E35C-11EF-9051-DC2A5E1AEA54&amp;at_link_type=web_link&amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;at_ptr_name=twitter&amp;at_bbc_team=editorial&amp;at_format=link&amp;at_link_origin=BBCNews">Google quietly dropped</a> its previous commitment to not use AI for developing weapons and surveillance tools. Those pentagon contracts are obviously too juicy to ignore. This one doesn&rsquo;t bother me so much. The use of AI is inevitable. <a href="https://www.palantir.com">Palantir</a> is already leading the way.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2025/02/07/recaptcha-819-million-hours-of-wasted-human-time-and-billions-of-dollars-google-profit.html">The next bit of news</a>, which is actually based on research published in 2023 (so not really news), relates to those seriously annoying popups you get when you visit many sites across the web. You know the ones I mean, when you have to prove you&rsquo;re a human, and not a bot, by discerning letters or images from a blurry image, or clicking on squares in an image to pick out bicycles.</p>
<p>These tests are called CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart).</p>
<p>In 2007, Luis von Ahn had the foresight to use CAPTCHAs to help digitise scanned text from books and newspapers that computers struggled to read. He called this reCAPTCHA. The New York Times even used it to digitise its archive of 13 million articles dating back to 1851.</p>
<p>Google acquired reCAPTCHA in 2009 and used it to digitise Google Books and improve Google Street View by processing photos of street signs and house numbers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As it turns out, Google has turned it into a mass surveillance tool which benefits nobody but itself.</p>
<p>Over 512 billion reCAPTCHAs have been solved historically, costing an estimated 819 million human hours and $6.1 billion USD in lost labor, whilst consuming 134 petabytes of bandwidth and 7.5 million kWh of energy, contributing significantly to CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>All this for what? Certainly not for security. Security professionals have known for a while that bot developers have learnt how to get around them.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10911">You can read the analysis yourself</a> but I&rsquo;ll summarise what it says about Google&rsquo;s use of reCAPTCHAv2.</p>
<p>reCAPTCHAv2 collects user behavioural data beyond just solving captchas. It tracks users before, during, and after captcha interactions. It uses a risk analysis system that considers factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>User’s browsing history</li>
<li>Cookies stored on the browser</li>
<li>Browser environment details (e.g., screen resolution, user agent, canvas rendering)</li>
<li>Mouse movements and other behavioural cues.</li>
</ul>
<p>It basically works as a covert user tracking mechanism. All the data is sent to Google servers, who then use it in their advertising ecosystem as yet another way to track you and serve ads.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a web developer, you might want to think twice before embedding a reCAPTCHA in a form.</p>
<p>For everyone else, your mileage will vary if you try and automatically block these.</p>
<p>You could disable javascript in your web browser, but then that kills the functionality of most sites across the web.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had varied success with Content Blockers that you can install as browser extensions or plugins. A lot of content/ad blockers say that they can block it, but it&rsquo;s not so easy. Google loads the reCAPTCHA in an external iframe served from Google. iFrames are not so easy to block. If they&rsquo;re embedded in a form, you may be able to block the entire form automatically using a content blocker, or manually using a feature such as &lsquo;Hide Distracting Items&rsquo; which is now available in Apple&rsquo;s Safari browser. Invoking Reader mode also doesn&rsquo;t always work.</p>
<p>What about using a VPN? If you use a VPN (I use Private Relay which comes with iCloud+, which is essentially a VPN), these will hide your IP address from Google. All this achieves though is making it more likely you will be repeatedly served reCAPTCHAs.</p>
<p>Maybe one day regulatory authorities will get their act together and stop this crap. GDPR certainly didn&rsquo;t. All the EU&rsquo;s flagship privacy regulations did was serve us annoying cookie banners. So annoying that 99.9% of users just automatically click &lsquo;Accept Cookies&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Remember, Google quietly removed “Don’t be evil” from its official corporate code of conduct in 2018.</p>
<p>The battle continues.</p>

		<a href="https://darylhaines.com/2025/02/05/the-australian-experience-of-tariffs.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-05 22:11:45 &#43;0100">Feb 5, 2025</time></a>

			 <p>I learnt something new listening to the excellent podcast ‘<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/russia-if-youre-listening/id1381291342?i=1000686739596">If You’re Listening</a>’.</p>
<p>We all know the talk of the day is tariffs and the potential economic impact of Donald Trump’s impending plans.</p>
<p>After World War II, the majority of developed countries slowly got rid of major tariffs and embraced free trade. An exception was Australia. Australia kept high tariffs right up until the 90s in order to protect Australian manufacturing.</p>
<p>One result was that Australians didn’t get colour TV until 1974. 20 years behind the U.S and years behind many other countries.</p>
<p>In 1973, tariffs on foreign-made TVs were at 180%. Due to concerns about rising inflation, Prime Minister Whitlam asked the National Tariff Board to review the situation, and by the time that colour TV was introduced, he had dropped the tariff to 35%.</p>
<p>At the time, the biggest electronics company in Australia was AWA. In fact, from the late 30s to the late 50s, AWA&rsquo;s headquarters was the tallest building in Australia. AWA thrived with the help of the Australian government. The Australian government wanted a domestic electronics industry and everyone wanted to protect Australian jobs.</p>
<p>The thing is, anyone with an inkling of knowledge about economics knows that the cost of production is largely driven by two factors: labour costs and economies of scale - the more you sell, the less it costs to produce per item.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the population of Australia was 13 million - a small market. Australia also had higher labour costs than Asian countries. You can see the problem here. Even with tariffs set at 35%, AWA could no longer compete with Asian competitors.</p>
<p>By the end of 1975, AWA had laid off 2,000 factory workers. The industry was in a nosedive and it was a sign of things to come for Australian manufacturing in general. Throughout the 80s and 90s, one by one, the tariffs were dropped. And one by one, the industries they had been protecting disappeared.</p>
<p>A similar story has played out in many developed western countries, including the UK, and significantly, the U.S. We all now pay a lot less for goods, but the cost has been the loss of many blue-collar jobs and industries, and a rising wealth gap between rich and poor.</p>
<p>This sets the scene, perversely, for Donald Trump&rsquo;s election in 2016. He promised to bring back manufacturing jobs, particular in those Rust Belt states that ultimately helped him win the election.</p>
<p>Then, and now, he has repeated the mantra that Americans were being ripped off by foreign countries, and tariffs would force them to pay. This is despite the fact that we know, and he knows, and I&rsquo;m sure even the MAGA cult knows, that tariffs are paid by importers, not by the foreign companies selling into America.</p>
<p>In his first term, economists estimate that Trump&rsquo;s tariffs cost American consumers $72 billion in the first year alone.</p>
<p>So the price of goods went up, but did he fulfil his promise by bringing manufacturing jobs back to America?</p>
<p>Well, in a lot of cases the plan backfired.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve found that Trump&rsquo;s 25% tariff on steel, for instance, raised costs for American factories that relied on imported steel and led to a net loss of 76,000 jobs.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t think that what worked prior to the 80s will work in 2025. The global economy is tightly integrated. Almost every complex product in the world has components coming from different countries. For instance, there&rsquo;s not a single US-made TV that doesn&rsquo;t have components from China, Mexico or elsewhere.</p>
<p>As for income inequality, In 1980, Americans with degrees used to earn 40% more than those without degrees. Now it&rsquo;s 80% more, and it&rsquo;s largely these people without degrees who have now, twice, elected Donald Trump to fix the problem.</p>
<p>As the podcast points out, if Trump targeted tariffs at specific products and industries, it might incentivise companies to open factories in America. It would mean higher prices for certain products, but that may be a price that Americans are willing to pay to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. However, the 2025 version of Trump tariffs are not targeted. The world&rsquo;s largest economy is on the path of implementing broad sweeping tariffs against anyone and everyone. It&rsquo;s going to have ramifications for us all.</p>

			 <p>I’ve found that I’m pretty good at guessing the year a song was released - as long as that year was in the 80s.</p>
<p>I’m not too bad at the 60s and 70s, even though I wasn’t born until 1975.</p>
<p>I struggle a bit with the 90s. Those were my drinking and sailing years, so it’s all a bit of a blur (no pun intended - I preferred Oasis). The decade is fairly easy to identify but I’m usually out by a year or two. I just remember - early 90s: Nirvana and Grunge, as well as pretty crap dance music; mid 90s: BritPop; mid-to-late 90s: Spice Girls, Take That, etc., and the re-emergence of Alt-Rock (Radiohead, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins).</p>
<p>For the noughties onwards, I’m ok at identifying the artist or song, but as for the year - useless!</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to think why this is. My initial theory was that we’re not seeing a revolution in music styles and genres that we saw in earlier decades.</p>
<p>The 80s in particular were an amazingly diverse time for music. There was so much going on, each genre with its own little sub-culture. You have the New Romantics such as Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran and Culture Club; Goths such as The Cure and The Sisters of Mercy; Glam Metal; Ska-revival; Reggae; Synth Pop; New Wave, Thrash Metal; Post-Punk; the early days of Hip-Hop, House and Techno; and so much more.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be nostalgic about the 80s.</p>
<p>There is of course a bias underpinning my love of the 80s. Studies have shown that our musical preferences are shaped during adolescence and early teenage years. For me, that lines up with the 80s, whereas Generation Z — born in 2000 or later — <a href="https://today.yougov.com/entertainment/articles/36462-best-decade-for-music-americans-poll-data">really do believe that the 2010s was the best decade</a>. So was the 80s a uniquely great decade, or is it simply, as science suggests, that I was at an age where my <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9842905/">orbitofrontal cortex reward system was sensitive and highly engaged</a>?</p>
<p>I certainly went through a dramatic evolution in musical tastes in my teens. I went from being a <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/artist/bros/17628751">Bros</a> fan in 1988 with short spiky hair, to a metalhead in 1991 with longish hair, even attending the iconic <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/festival/1991/monsters-of-rock-england-1991-73d6b66d.html">Donington Monsters of Rock Festival that year</a>. Those extremes were short-lived.</p>
<p>I was never really into cool music at the time it was considered cool. I remember a group of friends being heavily in to The Smiths while I was probably listening to the great works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_Aitken_Waterman">Stock Aitken Waterman</a>. Now, of course, I love The Smiths.</p>
<p>As with many people, I went through that period when I ‘discovered’ the Beatles. I read the authorised biography of <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781407027524">the Beatles by Hunter Davies</a> (first published in 1968 - before the split). I love reading biographies about cultural icons because you can make it interactive by listening to, or watching, their work when you get to the corresponding chapter of the book.</p>
<p>In the case of the Beatles, I followed the book and listened to every album in order, analysed every song, furthered my research with thanks to Wikipedia, documentaries, YouTube and podcasts. I went all in for a while. There’s a reason why the Beatles are generally considered to be the greatest band of all time. It’s not just all the record-breaking stats and the phenomenon of Beatlemania. They transformed the music industry. Listen to their music from 1963 and compare it to 1969. Not only did their music evolve, once they gave up touring and spent more time in the studio, they became extremely innovative - pushing the boundaries of recording techniques, songwriting and production. They influenced everyone around them and shaped the evolution of the music industry the 60s and beyond. My favourite Beatles album - <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/revolver/1441164670">Revolver</a>.</p>
<p>I highly recommend my interactive book experience. I’ve done the same with many other biographies from icons of music, sport, films, politics and historical figures. It’s like creating your own documentary.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780142181218">Mike Tyson autobiography</a> is a good example. At the time the book was released, I was able to follow along and watch pretty much every fight on YouTube. Unfortunately, a lot of those videos of his early fights have since been pulled. You can of course watch the highlights of his career but it’s not the same as watching every fight and hearing, in his own words, what factors influenced his boxing style, mentality and (tragically) the direction of his career. Boxing critics argue on where he stands amongst the greats. I just know that for a time, he was unstoppable. And then, Cus D’Amato died, and Don King (and drugs) got their hooks into him. Whether you like him or not, the story is epic, Shakespearean even. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Back to music and my inability to guess the year from this century.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t know music. I’m a bit of a music nerd (no surprise), but not in the traditional sense. It has been a while since I’ve regularly read music magazines or gone to gigs. No, my particular nerdiness is that for over 20 years now I have digitally collected music and rated every single song in my library. I’m a stats man. Through ratings and extensive use of smart playlists, I could recall, for instance, my favourite rock songs from 1978, or my highest rated dance tracks with a BPM (beats per minute) below 140.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the support for star ratings and smart playlists is the main reason I haven’t switched from Apple Music to Spotify.</p>
<p>My digital ratings system started on Windows, I believe around 2000. I think the app was MusicMatch Jukebox. I may be wrong. I also remember using Winamp and later Last.fm. That all changed when Apple released iTunes for Windows in 2003. I had an iPod so the easy syncing made complete sense. I made the full switch to an Apple Mac and iPhone in 2008. They’ve had me locked in ever since!</p>
<p>Incidentally, Yahoo acquired MusicMatch and then later killed it. Indicative of the general demise of Yahoo from an Internet giant to a footnote.</p>
<p>My system is simple. If I find a song I instantly like I add it to my library and give it an initial 3 star rating. Many of my playlists have criteria that start with songs rated 3* or greater. These songs will usually go in to my Recently Liked playlist. I regularly review this playlist and try and keep in under 100 songs. Before removing the song I&rsquo;ll review the rating and maybe add it to one of my other playlists.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m on the fence about a song I might add it to my library anyway. This then shows up in my Unrated playlist.  It usually takes 3 or 4 listens to each track before I’ve decided on a rating. Sometimes more. Unfortunately for me, this often means that the yearly Apple Replay playlists that Apple automatically generate are dominated by songs which perhaps weren&rsquo;t my favourites from the year.</p>
<p>If the song is from an artist I already like I’ll usually add the associated album to my library. If it’s from a new artist, I might quickly scan through the album to get an idea whether the album stands up to the quality of the single.</p>
<p>I once made the mistake of adding loads of classic 70s albums to my library in one go. This sent my Unrated playlist up to about 2000 songs. It took me nearly 2 years to get through it. It became more of a chore than enjoyable.</p>
<p>I now find that I add a lot less new music to my library. Again, studies suggest that once you reach middle age you stop listening to new music. There’s a reason that BBC Radio 1 and 2 have different demographics. I still listen to new music but it’s certainly not at the same rate as previous years.</p>
<p>I think it’s partly a reflection of age, but also has something to do with the times in which we live. We are in an age of abundant options. It was once second nature to pick up a book while listening to an album on my Walkman. Today, it could take me half an an hour to decide whether to watch a film, TV show, or Youtube, or listen to an audiobook or podcast, perhaps doomscroll the news, get lost in the nonsense on social media, or catch up my never ending RSS blogs feed. I end up falling asleep in decision paralysis.</p>
<p>It was easier when I had a full-time job. Music helped me concentrate. Now I find I have to make time for music and rely on reminders. I rely on the Friday notification of new album releases on my phone, or the notification from BBC Sounds that there&rsquo;s a new episode of my favourite radio show - <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07jcj7v">Trevor Nelson&rsquo;s Rhythm Nation</a>.</p>
<p>My early years were influenced by watching Top of the Pops, listening to the Top 40 countdown on Radio 1 on a Sunday, and reading Smash Hits magazine. I had no money to collect physical albums. It was the days of recording songs off the radio on to cassette tapes. The first ever single I bought with own money was <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/i-wanna-dance-with-somebody-who-loves-me/840431884?i=840431935">I Wanna Dance with Somebody by Whitney Houston</a>. Whitney Houston remains my favourite female vocalist of all time. That would have been on vinyl. If only we had all kept all our vinyl records from back in the day. Who knew they would make a comeback?</p>
<p>In the 90s I was living on warships so had limited options. In the early 90s that would be a handful of cassette tapes. Later, mp3 players came along but storage was minute. It wasn’t until the iPod came along in 2001 that you could fit ‘1000 songs in your pocket’.</p>
<p>I can remember deployments based on the small number of albums I had on repeat. Each deployment had its own soundtrack. For example, my memory of a specific Arabian Gulf deployment is sunbathing on the flight deck in scorching heat listening to <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/whats-the-story-morning-glory/1517447039">(What’s the Story) Morning Glory? by Oasis</a>, and <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/seal-ii/302788213">Seal II</a> on constant repeat. That would put it around 1995.</p>
<p>Today, things are very different. We have millions of songs in our pocket. For a long while my listening was dominated by playlists. I think it’s the same for most people. More recently, I’ve made a conscious effort to listen to full albums, with songs in order, not shuffled. It’s a different experience. The great albums tell a story, with a beginning, a middle and an end. It’s not just a collection of songs.</p>
<p>Despite my Apple Music subscription, I’ve found the Apple Music app is not the best option for listening to albums. You can of course search, or navigate, to a specific album, but let’s say you want to listen to a smart playlist of your 5* albums.</p>
<p>First of all, It’s 2025 and the Apple Music app on iOS still doesn’t allow us to create smart playlists. We have to first create them in the Mac app.</p>
<p>Secondly, there seems to be a long running bug in iTunes, that has carried through to the Apple Music app, where playlists don’t remember your selected view type or sort criteria. For example, in my nerdiness, I have separate playlists containing the best albums (based on my ratings) for every single year going back to the early 70s. I’ll set the view type of the playlist to ‘as Album’, sorted based on album rating, but later, both on iOS and MacOS, it will revert to the default, which is as a playlist of all songs based on the order that songs were added to the playlist. First world problems, I know, but frustrating.</p>
<p>One other problem is that Apple lets you specify the year, but this is the year of the song, not album. There is no separate filter option for album year. This means that sometimes albums might be split across 2 years as album release date and song release date are not always the same. What I end up doing is creating a separate manual playlist for each year based on the results of the corresponding smart playlist. You can see the Album Year in the metadata for an album, it&rsquo;s just not a filtering option.</p>
<p>On iOS i get around a lot of these problems by using the excellent app <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/marvis-review-the-ultra-customizable-apple-music-client/">Marvis</a> which let&rsquo;s you create your own customised version of Apple Music, and includes the ability to create smart playlists and keeps the albums view.</p>
<p>I have lots of playlists and playlist groups. I have an A List group - this contains the playlists I play most often. Then a B List. I have a Favourite Artists group. This contains playlists for dozens of my favourite bands and artists where each playlist just includes the songs from the artists I&rsquo;ve rated as 3* or above - filtering the wheat from the chaff. I have a grouping with smart playlists for different genres. Where the genre is a favourite of mine, such as Soul/RnB, I have separate groupings for these. For example, my Slow Jams playlist is very different to my Motown playlist.</p>
<p>I have a party grouping, with playlists I&rsquo;ve created over the years for home BBQs, friends round for dinner, or even parties for specific events (for example when we were lucky enough to live in an apartment that had arguably the best view in Brisbane for the annual <a href="https://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/whats-on/2025/riverfire-2025">RiverFire</a> event). I find it hard to delete these playlists - they&rsquo;re a little snapshot of time.</p>
<p>I have a grouping for Movie and TV soundtrack playlists that I&rsquo;ve created. If I watch a film and really enjoy the score or soundtrack, I&rsquo;ll often create my own playlist if I can&rsquo;t find one shared by another Apple Music user. It&rsquo;s easy to find the music from a film with help from sites such as <a href="https://www.tunefind.com">TuneFind</a>. I&rsquo;ve contributed to TuneFind myself when I&rsquo;ve created a playlist that&rsquo;s either missing entirely or is missing certain tracks.</p>
<p>I even have different Xmas playlists. My Classy Christmas playlist is very different from my Party Christmas playlist. I have no real naming convention. Sometimes it&rsquo;s obvious, like &rsquo;80s Power Ballads', and sometimes less obvious, like &lsquo;Teenage Wasteland&rsquo;. I know what they all mean.</p>
<p>You get the picture.</p>
<p>As of now, I have rated close to 26,000 songs. It would take me 71 days to listen to them all. It&rsquo;s a similar story for films, but let&rsquo;s leave it there. I&rsquo;m starting to re-think my life choices.</p>

			 <p>I woke up this morning with a feeling of dread. For once, it was nothing to do with my health problems. No, I quickly remembered that today is Inauguration Day for President Trump.</p>
<p>What will we have in store for this term? He is an agent of chaos. Completely unpredictable. Anything can happen. I can feel the jitters everywhere - from immigrants, European politicians,  Ukrainians, financial markets, you name it.</p>
<p>Just in the last 48 hours, before he has even taken the oath of office, he has already enriched himself by launching a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/20/tech/meme-coins-donald-melania-trump-intl-hnk/index.html">meme coin cryptocurrency</a>, increasing his net worth by many billions. This tells you everything about where his priorities lie.</p>
<h2 id="tiktok">TikTok</h2>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">TikTok debacle</a>. For those not paying attention, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) was signed into law back in April, with bipartisan support, requiring ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, to either divest its holdings to a US buyer or be shut down in the US by the 19th Jan 2025.</p>
<p>Despite what you may hear, the Act may have been written with TikTok in mind but it has a broad scope and can be applied to any app owned by a foreign adversary such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran. It just requires a national security review to designate the app as a threat.</p>
<p>In the case of TikTok, behind-doors intelligence briefings were given to the Senate Intelligence Committee and House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which helped shape the legislation and convince them of the risk posed.</p>
<p>Most news articles focus on the risk to data privacy. I think the bigger threat is the potential manipulation of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Social media apps with billions of users have the power to enact social engineering on an enormous scale. There&rsquo;s a massive social experiment going on right now and we&rsquo;re all human guinea pigs. This isn&rsquo;t limited to TikTok. Facebook wrote the book on this stuff.</p>
<p>The particular problem with Chinese-owned apps is all Chinese companies, including foreign subsidiaries, are subject to the National Intelligence Law of the People’s Republic of China (2017). Article 7 requires individuals and organisations to cooperate with state intelligence work, and not disclose to anyone the cooperation. Article 16 gives CCP intelligence agencies broad authority to conduct intelligence oversight of businesses.</p>
<p>We already know that social media can play a significant role in shaping opinions. The algorithm dictates what you see in your feed. It can, and already has, shaped elections. It can foment anger and divisiveness by prioritising content that supports a particular opinion, and downgrading content that supports the opposite opinion.</p>
<p>Traditional news media has done this forever. We all know about Fox News, but let&rsquo;s take the supposedly impartial BBC as an example. You don&rsquo;t have to conduct statistical analysis of news posts to know that the BBC prominently published any news that was critical of Brexit, and downranked or failed to publish articles that were supportive of Brexit. The same is happening now with regards to Israel and Gaza. It&rsquo;s bias by omission, and It&rsquo;s institutional bias because the editorial teams are human beings.</p>
<p>Many years ago I read &lsquo;My Trade: A Short History of British Journalism&rsquo; by Andrew Marr. Published in 2004, Marr stated:</p>
<p><em>“The BBC is not impartial or neutral. It’s a publicly funded, urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people, ethnic minorities, and gay people. It has a liberal bias, not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias.”</em></p>
<p>In the case of social media apps, instead of editorial decisions, we have algorithms, written by humans, that have in-built bias. That&rsquo;s a significant problem when the owners are subject to the objectives of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>With regards to data privacy, yes that&rsquo;s an issue, but that ship sailed a long time ago. Vast swathes of everyone&rsquo;s personal data is already in the hands of data brokers, and the CCP can easily buy the data any time they want.</p>
<p>Back to what happened yesterday. In compliance with the law, and after the Supreme Court upheld the law, TikTok shut down operations in the US. Then, Donald Trump, who isn&rsquo;t even in office yet, posted on his Truth Social that gave assurance that he would give TikTok a 90 days reprieve. He&rsquo;s now offering that ByteDance US can be 50% owned by a US company instead of full divestment. TikTok was down for all of 14 hours before they restored services, in violation of US law. As of writing, Google and Apple are not yet playing ball - the apps can&rsquo;t be downloaded from the Apple App Store of Google Play Store. This doesn&rsquo;t effect users who have already installed the apps.</p>
<p>TikTok services in the US are hosted by Oracle, and their Content Delivery Network (CDN) is provided by Akamai. Let&rsquo;s not forget, Larry Ellison, the co-founder and Chairman of Oracle, helped Trump&rsquo;s best mate Elon Musk buy Twitter. He personally donated $1 billion of the $44 billion purchase price.</p>
<p>Join the dots. This is all a big scam. Trump negotiates behind the scenes. TikTok goes down, then gets restored, and TikTok posts a message on its app thanking their saviour Donald Trump. Shou Zi Chew, the CEO of TikTok, is attending the Inauguration. Unlike Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and the rest of the US technocracy, we don&rsquo;t know if he made any financial contributions to the inauguration committee, because donations by foreign individuals are illegal under US law.</p>
<p>One interesting point amidst all of this is that Senator Tom Cotton, Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, tweeted the following:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Any company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs. Think about it.&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1881038993875140640">https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1881038993875140640</a></p>
<p>Perhaps a prediction of what is to come. Maybe Donald Trump will not have it all his own way, despite Republican control of both houses of Congress.</p>
<p>Deciphering Donald Trump is harder than explaining the plot of <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/tenet/">Tenet</a> to a toddler. He previously supported the TikTok ban. Does he now like TikTok because he believed it helped him win the election? Is he cooking up a scheme to try and get ByteDance to sell TikTok to his mate Elon Musk? Who knows. All that can be said is that whatever decision he makes, his own interests will trump (no pun intended) any national security interests, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>Ominously, In <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-farewell-address-oval-office-8bc6051c20adc1bc212cdd8be2578624?utm_source=chatgpt.com">his farewell address on January 15</a>, President Biden expressed deep concerns about the emergence of an oligarchy in the United States. He highlighted the concentration of wealth and power among a small group of ultra-wealthy individuals, stating that this trend poses a significant threat to democracy, basic rights, and freedoms, specifically referring to the “tech-industrial complex”.</p>
<h2 id="tariffs">Tariffs</h2>
<p>Donald Trump thinks the answer to all US problems is tariffs. What he says and does are two different things but he has stated that he will set a 60% tariff on all imports from China, a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, and a 10-20% tariffs on imports from everywhere else. He threatened BRICS nations with a 100% tariffs if they dared to set up a reserve currency to challenge the US dollar.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going by 1920&rsquo;s protectionist policies that aim to roll back globalisation and force companies to increase the industrial base in the US.</p>
<p>The goal of national self-sufficiency is understandable, but economists argue on the impacts of his proposals. At least we have data from his first term. Tariffs raised the prices of components from overseas (there&rsquo;s many raw components that the US doesn&rsquo;t produce or is cheaper to buy overseas). Of course, these costs get passed on to the end customer, raising prices. Many countries, including China and the European Union, imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, negatively affecting industries such as agriculture and manufacturing. Studies suggest that the tariffs slightly dampened U.S. GDP growth during Trump’s first term, as they disrupted trade flows and increased costs.</p>
<p>This time, he&rsquo;s promising to go further and harder.</p>
<h2 id="ukraine">Ukraine</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to worry about a Trump second term. The mass deportation of illegal immigrants is probably going to cause chaos, whether you agree with the plans or not. There&rsquo;s also the unforeseen. It&rsquo;s clear to me from his handling of COVID and the Black Lives Matter protests that he&rsquo;s unpredictable and terrible in a crisis.</p>
<p>The thing that most worries me though is Ukraine.</p>
<p>During his election campaign he stated that he would end the Ukraine war in 24 hrs. Obviously that was nonsense and he&rsquo;s now saying maybe 6 months.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that he&rsquo;s going to push both sides for a negotiated settlement or ceasefire. The negotiated settlement would require Ukraine to give up sovereign territory. Both sides have already rejected a ceasefire on the basis it would just allow their opponents to re-arm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a big question around his relationship with President Putin. The new MAGA Republican party seemingly has a love of dictators. This started with Donald Trump&rsquo;s fondness for Putin, but where does that come from? Is it simply a case that he sees himself as a strongman and so likes leaders with common traits? Or his he compromised, as suggested by the Christopher Steele dossier? The truth is probably somewhere in-between.</p>
<p>We know from the Mueller Investigation that there was collusion between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign that helped him win the 2016 election. This was backed up by the Senate Intelligence Committee Report (2020).</p>
<p>We also know that the first impeachment was due to concerns that he placed pressure on Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>We may never get to the bottom of his motivations, we just have to go on what he has said and done.</p>
<p>On the positive, he did broadly support Ukraine during his first term. The Trump Administration provided training to Ukraine and armaments, including Javelin missiles that have played a crucial role in Ukraine&rsquo;s defence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he has surrounded himself with loyalists that are openly opposed to providing further military and financial assistance to Ukraine, particularly his Vice-President pick, J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>He is also threatening to pull out of NATO again unless countries increase defence expenditure. This is fair enough but this time he is demanding countries spend 5% of GDP on defence. A figure that most countries, including the UK, has no hope of reaching.</p>
<p>Luckily, Ukraine is in a much stronger position now than it was perhaps a year ago. The Kursk offensive means they have a hold in Russian territory with which to negotiate. They have also massively increased their own domestic armaments production. Significantly, with the investment from allies, Ukraine is now able to <a href="https://ukrainetoday.org/drone-production-in-ukraine-the-ministry-of-defense-has-revealed-stunning-figures/">domestically produce 96% of its drones</a> on the front line.</p>
<p>The EU has never taken a leading role, in comparison to the US, but at least in October the EU approved a loan of up to €35 billion for Ukraine. So in the case that the US pulls back, maybe the EU will fill the gap. I&rsquo;m not holding my breath. Especially when you consider what&rsquo;s going on with the German economy, as well as the efforts of Hungary and Slovakia to actively block any EU assistance.</p>
<p>In the next few hours he has promised a shock and awe of perhaps 200 Executive Orders. He has control of both houses of Congress and a conservative majority on the Supreme Court (who recently ruled that he has immunity against any crimes conducted as President).</p>
<p>Chaos awaits.</p>

			 <p>Lauren has finally spread her wings and left the nest. I suppose these days a child leaving home at the age of 23 is pretty common, if not early. The housing crisis means adults are often still living with their parents into their 30s.</p>
<p>Last week, we helped her move into her new place in London. She started her first professional job as a speech therapist today.</p>
<p>It’s going to be weird for all of us but I’m excited for her. A new job, new city, new flatmates and colleagues, and all the opportunities that they bring.</p>
<p>I lived and worked in London for 6 months in the 90s and it had a lasting impression on me. I loved every minute of it. I’m yet to find anywhere in the world that has the sheer number and variety of things to do and see. On my days off I would often walk for miles, purposely getting lost - a new discovery on every corner. London is endlessly fascinating. The plan was to have spent 2024 in London, but c’est la vie!</p>
<p>My current predicament means I’ll be living vicariously through her for a while, and I’ll definitely miss her support. She’s been helping Rach look after me since my diagnosis. I’ll forever be grateful.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When I settled in to watch Steve McQueen&rsquo;s latest film <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/blitz-2024/">Blitz</a>, I expected a stirring and dramatic portrayal of the resilience of Londoners under sustained Nazi bombing. Instead, I was served a two-hour lecture on race relations—a clunky, heavy-handed, and, frankly, badly executed one at that.</p>
<p>I should have known, based on Steve McQueen&rsquo;s previous work, but I was bamboozled by the marketing. The trailer bears no resemblance to the actual meat of the film.</p>
<p>If my Grandma was still alive, I would have to tell her that the stories she told me about the Blitz spirit were nothing more than a myth, if <em>Blitz</em> was to be believed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at a few critic&rsquo;s reviews of this film and the general consensus seems to be that McQueen should be applauded for telling a lesser-known side to this period of British history; an alternative to all those other boys-adventure, propaganda films.</p>
<p>The thing about those other films is that they are largely from the 40s, 50s and 60s. There are generations of people who may not have seen them. <em>Blitz</em> could be their first introduction to this story. It seems irresponsible to tell it this way. This perspective might have worked better as a documentary, where it could have been backed up by research from reputable historians.</p>
<p>Maybe I would even half-agree with the critics if the film was at least better made, and had a semblance of balance.</p>
<p>The character development is terrible, full of gross caricatures. The film paints a grim portrait of humanity, with the majority of characters portrayed as heartless opportunists.  While the black characters are portrayed as noble victims, a large number of the white characters are self-serving and cruel. Even when you think you’ve found a genuinely kind and selfless character, it turns out to be a cynical trick.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a section of the film that suddenly turns into Oliver Twist. As much as I like Stephen Graham and Kathy Burke, that whole section of the movie should have been left on the cutting room floor. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Later, the film turns into Titanic. It&rsquo;s one of the few genuinely dramatic scenes, but it only lends to the idea that it&rsquo;s a complete mess of a film.</p>
<p>The acting is ropey, at best, and I&rsquo;m not just talking about the kids, but the kids are the worst. Background child actors can get away with it but you would expect more from the lead. The poor kid displays absolutely no range or personality. Maybe this is by design. Perhaps we are supposed to believed that the lack of any kind of emotion is the character&rsquo;s way of dealing with trauma. Perhaps. For me, it was either bad writing, bad acting, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>The sound editing is also atrocious. Music and sounds intended to heighten tension were simply grating.</p>
<p>The writing and dialogue went from cheesy to bad. It doesn&rsquo;t help when it&rsquo;s set in the east end of London. I half expected Dick Van Dyke to make an appearance.</p>
<p>Much of it felt like it was made by a first-year film student who had just learned about the &ldquo;evils of the British empire&rdquo;. No room for nuance here.</p>
<p>And yet, in the midst of all this, there were flashes of genuine drama. A few scenes captured the terror and tension of wartime London pretty well. These moments hinted at what <em>Blitz</em> could have been, had it not been bogged down by its moralising and amateurish execution.</p>
<p>I did learn something new. I wasn&rsquo;t aware that the London underground stations were only opened as shelters after pressure from the local community. I had assumed opening them would have been straight out of the emergency planning book. Near the beginning, the films shows a bunch of jobsworths refusing to open stations with no explanation of why. You have to do your own research to find out that the authorities had genuine concerns about potential bombings trapping civilians underground.</p>
<p>In the end, <em>Blitz</em> isn’t the epic the trailer would have you believe. It’s more akin to a Ken Loach-style social-realist lecture, but without the authenticity or craft. There’s a difference between challenging national myths and outright dismantling them in such a ham-fisted way.</p>
<p>For all its pretensions, <em>Blitz</em> ends up feeling like a turkey—a missed opportunity to re-tell an important story.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://darylhaines.com/2024/11/26/why-is-uk.html">Why is UK Mobile Network Coverage So Bad?</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I get the feeling that my fellow Brits just accept the current status of mobile network coverage as normal. It’s not.</p>
<p>Any British expat who lives in a western country and comes back will be shocked. In fact, any Brit living here only needs to travel abroad on a short trip to realise how bad our coverage is.</p>
<p>I’ve been out of the country 17 years and I really don’t think it has advanced much. Even in London, I found regular black spots or areas that drop down to 3G. Sheffield is even worse. Once you leave the cities, it gets worse still. I’m in a village not far from Chesterfield and I’ve had to switch providers in an effort to get half-decent speeds and coverage.</p>
<p>The UK is in the process of decommissioning its 3G mobile networks, their goal being to shut down 3G so that they can move resources to improving 4G and 5G. EE and Vodafone have already completed the shutdown. Three plan to have theirs completed by the end of the year. O2 intends to begin the process in 2025.</p>
<p>My observations has been when 5G isn’t available, my phone switches to 3G, not 4G, indicating that 4G coverage is also lacking. A lot of the time I&rsquo;m switched on to 2G. 2G is passable for making voice calls but useless for handling today&rsquo;s apps and websites.</p>
<p>My experience is purely anecdotal. I haven’t studied the network coverage maps, but in 2024, I didn’t think I would need to.</p>
<p>I notice that <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860705853604790414?s=46&amp;t=m1AIkz9IHQYH_jpYy1vCcg">Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink is already doing deals with the major telcos </a>to add Starlink satellite coverage. This could be a game changer if the UK telcos get onboard, at least for outside coverage. Of course, Starlink satellite is no good indoors, unless you have a receiver. Then again, <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2024/10/21/book-review-elon.html">allowing a nutty billionaire to control the majority of the world&rsquo;s commercial satellite coverage</a> presents its own problems.</p>
<p>How long will it be before we see a vast improvement to 4G and 5G coverage? Judging by the last 17 years, much longer than the telcos say, that&rsquo;s my bet.</p>
<p>Britain has a lot of old pubs where mobile reception doesn&rsquo;t penetrate the thick walls. 5G is much better at penetrating walls, as long as there&rsquo;s a 5G tower/base station/cell, etc. in range. In this case, I don&rsquo;t mind in the least - pubs are a great place for switching off.</p>
<p>Everywhere else - come on! The UK is not a large country. It shouldn’t be this way.</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What is the strategy to re-open the Red Sea to all commercial shipping?</p>
<p>Operation Prosperity Guardian - the US-led coalition that aims to provide maritime security in the Red Sea - is now nearly a year into its mission. Since it commenced, at least 30 ships have been hit by the Houthis, and large container ships are still being routed around Africa.</p>
<p>I experienced firsthand the resulting delay and increase in insurance costs when we shipped our belongings from Australia to the UK.</p>
<p>The US Navy in particular has been taking the fight to the Houthis, attacking launch sites as they appear, but how sustainable is this? They’re just playing whack-a-mole, and the Houthis keep adapting their strategy to avoid being detected.</p>
<p>Coalition warships have been pretty effective, but they can&rsquo;t be everywhere. A few rough calculations (with the help of ChatGPT) tell me that the area of the Red Sea that needs to be patrolled off Yemen, taking into account the range of the current ballistic missile threat, is up to 94,000 square miles (300 miles offshore x 400 miles along the coast * 0.785 for an ellipse approximation).</p>
<h2 id="warship-defensive-capabilities">Warship Defensive Capabilities</h2>
<p>Coalition warships have so far shown the effectiveness of their drone and ballistic missile defence.</p>
<p>When I was in the Royal Navy in the 90s, we would look at the US Arleigh-Burke destroyers, with their AEGIS naval combat system,  in awe. They always looked to be far more capable than our Type 42 Destroyers, but they had never really been tested in combat. Well, now we know, they’re the real deal.</p>
<p>Today’s RN’s Type-45 destroyers, with the Sea Viper air defence system and SAMPSON radar, have also proven their capability. Both HMS Duncan and HMS Diamond have rotated in and out as part of the task force.</p>
<p>What worries me is that it only takes a mechanical/software failure or human error, and sooner or later, one of the missiles could hit a warship. What happens then?</p>
<p>Aircraft Carriers operate in a Carrier Strike Group, with warships around it providing layered fleet protection. I’m not so worried about a strike on a Carrier, despite the rubbish you read in the press.</p>
<p>What concerns me is the destroyers and frigates in isolation. Perhaps leaving a tasking for shore-leave or heading home.</p>
<p>The official strategy is to provide maritime security while letting sanctions do their work to erode the Houthis’ capability, whilst also pursuing diplomatic efforts with Iran to stop them arming the Houthis.</p>
<p>This could take years. Meanwhile, Iranian drone and missile development continues to advance, no doubt with Russian assistance. The whole strategy seems flawed to me, especially when you consider the cost of sending a missile up to shoot down a drone.</p>
<h2 id="could-trump-make-a-difference">Could Trump Make a Difference?</h2>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the strategy changes with the new US administration. It could get worse. The America First approach could see the US Navy withdraw from the Red Sea completely.</p>
<p>Then again, Trump’s first term shows that he likes to be a player on the world stage, and he did have some real foreign policy wins. I also suspect, because everything ultimately is about money to him, that he will not like the cost of Operation Prosperity Guardian. That doesn’t necessarily mean a withdrawal. It could be a strategy to try and defeat the Houthis sooner rather than later. This could mean a harder approach on Iran, combined with tougher military action to defeat the Houthis.</p>
<p>Let’s look at his first-term approach to defeat ISIS. Much of the groundwork was laid by Obama, but Trump can credibly claim that he expanded the air campaign, increased support to local partners in the region, and loosened some of the rules of engagement for regular and special forces. This resulted in significant losses of territory for ISIS and diminished them as a fighting force.</p>
<p>Trump seems to love strategic ambiguity. Whether this is by design is up for debate. What it does mean is that anything can happen in the next four years.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had an account on BlueSky for a while but only check it sporadically. I try to limit my social media consumption, and X remains the best platform for my relevant interests (Ukraine, AI, Tech, etc), despite the change in ownership.</p>
<p>I did check BlueSky yesterday out of interest and I&rsquo;ve noticed a significant change. Rather than being a &lsquo;safe place&rsquo; as is the general consensus, it has now become a left-wing echo chamber. You can probably train the algorithm to remove political content, but that takes work. I talked in a previous post about my efforts on X to remove political content from my feed, of any persuasion.</p>
<p>The bifurcation of social media platforms along political lines is a worrying trend. Mastodon is better, but it still hasn&rsquo;t caught on for the majority of accounts I&rsquo;m interested in following. There is still a slight technical barrier. I&rsquo;ve said before, the network-effect always wins.</p>

			 <p>I received some good news this week. The first full bone marrow biopsy results have finally come back following the <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2024/08/21/transplant-failed-what.html">CAR-T infusion</a>, and it’s Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) negative. It doesn’t mean I’m cured but it supposedly makes it less likely that I’ll relapse any time soon. The CAR-T seems to have done its job.</p>
<p>I’m still at risk from graft vs host disease from the transplant, and I’m still at risk from complications from the CAR-T. CAR-T can’t distinguish between cancerous b-cells and good b-cells, and b-cells control the immune system.</p>
<p>The CAR-T team are also continuing me on oral chemo for a year as a belt and braces approach.</p>
<p>As since the beginning of this nightmare, my general health and susceptibility to infection is largely dependant upon my blood levels. The chemo knocks them down so I have to have twice weekly G-CFS injections (administered by my wife at home who seems to quite enjoy stabbing me) to boost the levels back up. It&rsquo;s the Neutrophil and Platelet levels that are constantly up and down. If the Neutrophils are below 1.0 or the Platelets are below 50 I have to be really careful.</p>
<p>Despite all that I’m taking this week as a win and for the first time in a while I&rsquo;ve actually started to feel pretty good. I&rsquo;ve started a rehabilitation program at our local leisure centre and many of my ongoing symptoms have subsided. I still have neuropathy in my feet so I think my running days are over, but there&rsquo;s plenty of other stuff I can do. This week I also had the PICC line taken out of my arm so I’ll be able to go swimming again in a few days, so that&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>8 weeks post-CAR-T (which is soon), I&rsquo;ll be able to drive again. I won&rsquo;t lie, I&rsquo;m a little nervous about that. I&rsquo;ve only driven once since I was first diagnosed in July last year.</p>
<p>My hair has grown back nicely. Not only do I now have dark hair (previously grey), but it also seems thicker than before. Maybe taking on the stem cells of a younger man has de-aged me. I feel like Benjamin Button! The oral chemo is only a low maintenance dose for now so hopefully my hair stays like this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying not to get too excited about the recovery. After all, it was 5 months after the stem cell transplant that I relapsed.</p>
<p>I can take solace that the medical community seems to be genuinely excited about the CAR-T results they are seeing. I&rsquo;m actually the first Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) patient to have CAR-T at Sheffield Hallamshire hospital. It&rsquo;s that new that they&rsquo;re still trying to work out which team will monitor me long time, given I have had both a stem cell transplant and CAR-T.</p>
<p>For anyone interested, in early clinical trials CAR-T also seems to be having results for other conditions. I read on <a href="https://kottke.org/24/11/0045579-wow-more-than-40-people">Kottke</a> more than 40 people have undergone a CAR-T-cell therapy for lupus, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/11/lupus-car-t-immune-reset-autoimmune-disease/680521/?gift=j9r7avb6p-KY8zdjhsiSZxQpx4b-zn_lG0vR0rOFknk">most of whom have gone into drug-free remission</a>.</p>

			 <p>I recently finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781982181284">Elon Musk</a> the authorised biography by Walter Isaacson 📚, who also wrote the authorised biography of Steve Jobs shortly before he died. I mention it because there are some clear similarities between Elon Musk and Steve Jobs, which I&rsquo;m sure is not news to anyone.</p>
<p>When I read biographies about business tycoons I&rsquo;m never much interested in the sections on their personal lives, except for as much as it goes someway to explain their personalities, what drives them, and some of the factors that may have led to their successes and failures.</p>
<p>The book delves into Musk&rsquo;s personal life and childhood, and it&rsquo;s clear how his relationship with his father and his experiences of being bullied at school influenced him later in life.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is a complicated man. It&rsquo;s very easy to write him off as some right-wing nut-job, as many have.</p>
<p>Since he bought Twitter (now X), started spouting conspiracy theories, and is now an active Trump supporter, troves of seemingly sensible people suddenly decided that he his akin to Hitler. What&rsquo;s more, they then used this as a justification to write nonsense undermining what he has achieved. According to a lot of journalists and others that I follow online, the case goes that Musk isn&rsquo;t a very good engineer, he&rsquo;s been lucky, he&rsquo;s not a genius and just takes credit for the work of his staff. Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Of course, no man is an island and he could not have achieved what he has unless he hired brilliant engineers. The question is though, could the engineers have achieved success if they weren&rsquo;t driven by a hugely demanding, difficult boss who sets near impossible goals? Could Apple have come back from near bankruptcy in the 90&rsquo;s if Steve Jobs had not returned and set the company on a new path?</p>
<p>Like him or loathe him, it&rsquo;s clear to me that Elon Musk is one of those once in a generation entrepreneurs who you would hate to work for, but who really is changing the world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could work for him, but I understand those who do. If you go to work for one of Elon&rsquo;s companies you know what you&rsquo;re letting yourself in for. For a start, there&rsquo;s zero job security. He fires people on a whim. He personalises blame - lashing out at individuals for the slightest transgression. The result is a culture of immense pressure and fear. However, if you have a thick-skin and are confident in your abilities, the upside is that you get to work on career-defining projects that could potentially change the world. Not to mention the potential for excellent renumeration and share options which could set you up financially for life.</p>
<h2 id="elon-musk-companies">Elon Musk Companies</h2>
<p>As a reminder, this is where we currently are with Elon Musk&rsquo;s portfolio of companies:</p>
<h3 id="tesla">Tesla</h3>
<p>Musk has played a transformative role in the electric vehicle industry. I think it would be hard to argue that we would be seeing as many electric vehicles on the road today if Tesla has not led the way. As with some of his other companies, Tesla wasn&rsquo;t an immediate success. It very nearly went bankrupt and things could be a whole lot different now if his risk-taking had not paid off. His companies are very much interconnected. If Tesla had failed, this would have had a clear knock-on affect on his ability to develop the other businesses.</p>
<p>Despite what he tells people, Musk is not a founder of Tesla. Martin Eberhard probably deserves the most credit. Yet it&rsquo;s really only when Musk became the largest investor, took over day-to-day and started making product decisions that Tesla became a success.</p>
<p>Just last week I watched the Robotaxi event where he unveiled the self-driving cars that he&rsquo;s betting will turn Tesla into a 10 trillion dollar company. His vision is that we will be seeing fleets of these all over the world and most people will not be interested in buying a car anymore. It will make more financial sense just to hop into one of these. Who knows whether he&rsquo;s right. Only time will tell. Only a fool would bet against him though (just like the many fools who shorted Tesla stock).</p>
<p>Just like Steve Jobs, he seems to have the reality distortion field. Every year since 2016 he has been saying that full self-driving is only a year away. In his defence, he openly admits that he&rsquo;s extremely optimistic in his timeframes. The Robotaxi event, of course, failed to mention that Weymo (owned by Alphabet, who own Google) already have driver-less taxis on the roads in Phoenix, San Francisco, and is rolling them out to L.A and Austin, Texas.</p>
<h3 id="spacex">SpaceX</h3>
<p>The achievements he has made with SpaceX are mind-blowing. Again, only last week we were able to watch visions of the Super Heavy Booster from the Starship rocket launch, separate, and then land back on its launch pad - caught by mechanical arms, nicknamed &ldquo;Chopsticks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The progress with SpaceX is astonishing. Again, this was all due to massive risk-taking. At the beginning, if the company had just one more rocket failure it would have been game over - no more money to keep trying and no NASA contract.</p>
<p>To think that now SpaceX is responsible for launching 90% of all payload worldwide that goes into space.</p>
<p>SpaceX also has Starlink - the constellation of thousands of low-orbit satellites that are providing fast broadband to pretty much every corner of the earth. It&rsquo;s incredible, and slightly concerning, where this is going. Starlink can now compete with most ISP&rsquo;s around the world, and for dictatorships who control citizen&rsquo;s internet access I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very worrying. For the rest of us, it creates questions of what power this gives Elon Musk. We have already seen what happened when he decided to take unilateral action to shut off Starlink for Ukraine&rsquo;s assault on Crimea. Thankfully, that issue was resolved by delegating authority to the pentagon to make those decisions. We really don&rsquo;t want lone billionaire businessmen to have the ability to impact wars and geo-politics, yet this is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<h3 id="the-boring-company">The Boring Company</h3>
<p>A great name for a company. His aim is to revolutionise urban transportation by building underground tunnels to reduce traffic congestions. A short tunnel has been completed in Las Vegas but we&rsquo;re a long way from knowing whether or not this will be a success.</p>
<h3 id="neuralink">Neuralink</h3>
<p>Another of Musk&rsquo;s companies where you can&rsquo;t help but be in awe of what&rsquo;s being achieved. It&rsquo;s not the only company to be working on brain-computer interfaces to help cure paralysis, blindness and other neurological conditions, but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet against Neuralink eventually being a winner in the race.</p>
<h3 id="twitter-x">Twitter (X)</h3>
<p>Musk acquired Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion and immediately took it private. The changes he has made has reportedly resulted in advertisers fleeing the company in droves and many doubt that X is worth anywhere near $44 billion now. He&rsquo;s clearly playing the long game though. He has said his aim his for X to be like one of the big Chinese apps which basically does everything.</p>
<p>Twitter is a fascinating example of his core business philosophies at play. He waltzed in there (carrying a sink and tweeting &lsquo;Let that sink in&rsquo;) and quickly got to work laying off 75% of staff. Many commentators tweeted and wrote with glee that Twitter would start to fail within days. After all, you can&rsquo;t lay off that amount of staff and still expect the servers to keep running, can you?</p>
<p>Again, his risk-taking seems to have worked. Twitter stayed up and running.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read all kinds of nonsense about how X is now a cesspool because of the lack of moderation. That&rsquo;s not been my experience at all. If anything, it has improved. Whether you agree with him or not, his principle around content moderation has been freedom of speech but not freedom of reach. If you look for objectionable content on X you can find it, but that&rsquo;s it, you have to go looking. I found that my Twitter feed used to be full of angry political content whether I wanted it or not. Today, that&rsquo;s not the case. If you unfollow people who tweet politics, and make it clear to the algorithm that you don&rsquo;t want political content (by flagging users and posts you are not interested in), you won&rsquo;t see it. That&rsquo;s my results at least.</p>
<p>As soon as Musk took over Twitter there was a mass exodus of users who objected to his politics and the changes he was planning. The result was, for me anyway, it actually made the platform better. Those who left tended to be the opinionated gob-shites who couldn&rsquo;t help themselves to espousing their political views every 5 minutes. I would follow film-critics, business leaders, techies, and others in my areas of interest, but, as they are free to-do, I would also have to hear their latest uninformed opinion on whatever was going on in the political world.</p>
<p>In truth, I would love it if all the people I follow went over to Mastadon or Bluesky, but it hasn&rsquo;t happened. Social networks are only as good as their content. The network effect means that if, as I do, you want to get the latest and best news of what&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine, X remains the best platform because that&rsquo;s where all the best experts are.</p>
<p>Threads is doing quite well but it&rsquo;s a Meta (Facebook) company and I find it hard to trust Facebook after all their past transgressions.</p>
<h3 id="xai">X.AI</h3>
<p>Musk founded X.AI as a competitor to OpenAI (of which he was a co-founder). He is clearly not happy that OpenAI sold shares to Microsoft and is very bitter about how all that happened.</p>
<p>OpenAI (Chat-GPT) and Google Gemini are dominating the news cycle in terms of AI but I would not being against X.AI in the long term. He has a massive advantage. Hundreds of millions of hours of video content from Tesla cars combined with millions of tweets per hour from X gives him a huge amount of content to train neural networks. The race is on and the more competition the better it is for all of us. At least in Musk&rsquo;s case he is very concerned about AI safety. There&rsquo;s an extremely concerning passage in the book where he talks to Larry Page (Google) about AI safety and Page dismisses the risks, accusing Musk of being a &ldquo;specist&rdquo; (biased in favour of humans). It is partly this conversation that led Musk to co-found OpenAI, as a counter to Google&rsquo;s dominance.</p>
<h2 id="business-learnings">Business Learnings</h2>
<p>So what are they key traits and business philosophies of Elon Musk that has led to his success. Here&rsquo;s what I have summarised from the book:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First Principles</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>First principles thinking means he breaks down complex problems to their most basic components and then builds solutions from scratch. For example, at SpaceX he developed an &ldquo;idiot index&rdquo; to highlight the ridiculous costs of components. He pressured suppliers into reducing prices by demonstrating how the cost he was paying for raw materials for Tesla parts was substantially cheaper than what was being charged for SpaceX. It seems that using the words Aeronautics or Defence when making purchases is akin to saying the word &lsquo;Wedding&rsquo; at a flower shop. Everything immediately quadruples in price!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Relentless Efficiency</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Musk is obsessed with cost cutting and pays attention to the cost of every part of the process. He challenges every assumption and product specification. If a product spec says that a panel needs 5 rivets, he would get the engineers to test it with 3 rivets and take on the safety risk. At Tesla, he implemented a five-step algorithm for product development that included questioning every requirement, deleting unnecessary parts, simplifying proccesses, accelerating timelines, and only then automating the process.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>High Standards</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Musk sets extraordinarily high standards for product quality, obsessing over every detail. It&rsquo;s not enough that the product functionally works, it must also be beautiful and innovative. As an example, during the development of the Tesla Roadster, Musk insisted on modifying the Lotus body even though it increased costs and complexity.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Accountability and Feedback</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Musk has zero-tolerance to failure. He expects accountability from every member of his teams and often attributes failure to individuals, rather than teams, delivering harsh feedback. His review meetings are described as brutal. There are countless stories of him calling meetings at 11pm at night and requiring staff to immediately fly in that night from wherever they are in the country.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Musk believes in taking big risks and failing fast. You see this with a lot of the big tech companies. The &ldquo;move fast and break things&rdquo; philosophy certainly didn&rsquo;t start with Elon Musk but he has embraced it with gusto. At SpaceX he pushed engineers to break engines during testing to understand their limits. He ordered engineers to redesign the Starship&rsquo;s rocket&rsquo;s heat shield with stainless steel - a massive risk that paid off with new efficiencies. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that NASA would have taken the same risk.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Hardcore Work Ethic</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shortly after taking over Twitter, he sent out an email to all staff demanding that they work long hours at high intensity. Anyone who disagreed were let go. At Tesla, he drove teams to meet arbitrary, crazy production targets, even when working conditions led to higher-than-average injury rates in the factory.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Big Thinking. Audacious Goals.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s business ethos revolves around pursuing world-changing missions, such as making life multi-planetary or transitioning the world to sustainable energy. He sets seemingly impossible goals but galvanises his teams to accomplish remarkable results.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The book is a fascinating insight to an icon of our times. At every turn, he confounds his critics who write him off at every chance they can get.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t come across as a likeable person, that&rsquo;s for sure, but neither did Steve Jobs. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Unless you&rsquo;re one of his employees, or one of his many kids, those things really don&rsquo;t matter in the scheme of things. What matters is what he achieves and the impact he has on the world. The jury is still out on a lot of this.</p>
<p>One thing that does worry me is the amount of power he has. His vast wealth, the advances in AI, his politics, and his control over so much data, gives him a scary amount of power and influence. The future of the world could be dependent upon the whims of a deeply-flawed man who is prone to impulsive behaviour and risk-taking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the man is nuts, but maybe that&rsquo;s what it takes.</p>
<p><em>“Here’s to the crazy ones.</em></p>
<p><em>The misfits.</em></p>
<p><em>The rebels.</em></p>
<p><em>The troublemakers.</em></p>
<p><em>The round pegs in the square holes.</em></p>
<p><em>The ones who see things differently.</em></p>
<p><em>They’re not fond of rules.</em></p>
<p><em>And they have no respect for the status quo.</em></p>
<p><em>You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them.</em></p>
<p><em>About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.</em></p>
<p><em>Because they change things.</em></p>
<p><em>They invent. They imagine. They heal.</em></p>
<p><em>They explore. They create. They inspire.</em></p>
<p><em>They push the human race forward.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe they have to be crazy.</em></p>
<p><em>How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?</em></p>
<p><em>Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written?</em></p>
<p><em>Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?</em></p>
<p><em>We make tools for these kinds of people.</em></p>
<p><em>While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.</em></p>
<p><em>Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/heres-to-the-crazy-ones">Here&rsquo;s to the crazy ones</a></p>
<p><strong>Verdict: 5/5</strong> Isaacson’s biography offers a thorough and insightful exploration of one of the most influential and controversial figures of the 21st century. Elon Musk captures both the awe and the unease that Musk evokes, making it an essential read for those looking to understand the man behind some of the most transformative technologies of our time.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was hoping my next blog post would be a bit more positive. In fact, I wasn&rsquo;t even going to write this but I&rsquo;ve now had some time to come to terms with things, so here&rsquo;s where I am.</p>
<p>Life continues to lay dog turds in my path.</p>
<p>Things were going well. I was 160 days post transplant and had managed to avoid graft vs host disease or pick up any infections that would require re-admittance to hospital. I was getting out regularly and my fitness was gradually improving. I was even starting to think about when I could return to some kind of work.</p>
<p>As part of my fitness recovery and our re-introduction to the UK after 17 years in Australia, we had been getting out visiting local towns and cities. In the middle of July we went to Lincoln for the day. I was pleased to discover that unlike a lot of places we&rsquo;ve visited recently (a discussion for another day), Lincoln remains a lovely city to visit.</p>
<p>I was wondering whether I had recovered enough to tackle Steep Hill - the very steep street that takes you from the river up to the Castle and Cathedral. Well, I managed it. I was knackered by the end of the afternoon but I felt a sense of achievement (probably sounds strange to hear me celebrating managing to walk up Steep Hill - I&rsquo;m 49 not 89!).</p>
<p>Usually after a day&rsquo;s exertion it takes me a couple of days to recover. This time, we were 4 days later and I was still feeling it. My whole body was aching and I was getting various pains. I knew something wasn&rsquo;t right but just thought it was part of the ups and downs of post-transplant recovery.</p>
<p>I had also developed a lump on my face above my top lip. It was a hard lump. It didn&rsquo;t hurt, wasn&rsquo;t red or weeping. I didn&rsquo;t think it was enough to warrant another trip back to Sheffield Hospital. I did ring my GP however, who, over the phone, reckoned it was probably just a cyst and I should bring it up at my next visit to Haemotology, which would be the following Tuesday.</p>
<p>The following Tuesday came and I had had the usual blood tests before my clinic with a consultant from the Haemotology team. As soon as I went in for the clinic the doctor was looking at my blood test results and said &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re in trouble&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He explained that my white cells had rocketed up and it looks very much like my form of Leukaemia was back. I would need a bone marrow biopsy to confirm but in the meantime I would have to be admitted immediately as there&rsquo;s no time to mess around with this type of thing.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I knew something wasn&rsquo;t right but I never for a second thought I had relapsed. Both Rach and I were in shock.</p>
<p>The doctor explained that it was actually quite rare to relapse so soon after transplant. Lucky me. He also reminded me that my form of Leukaemia (ALL with Philadelphia B positive) doesn&rsquo;t have a good prognosis. A reality check.</p>
<p>I was admitted and the next day I had a bone marrow biopsy. They also arranged a biopsy of the lump on my lip. Both confirmed that it was Leukaemia.</p>
<h2 id="bone-marrow-biopsy">Bone Marrow Biopsy</h2>
<p>The bone marrow biopsy was horrendous - the worst one yet. They came into my room to do the procedure. Unlike in Australia where it was done under general anaesthetic, this was under local anaesthetic, and even though the doctor had requested it, there was no gas and air.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad Rach was in the room to see how horrendous it was. The extraction of the bone marrow from the hip and spine is bad enough but the worst bit is when they have to drill into the bone to take a sample of the actual bone. There&rsquo;s not enough local anaesthetic in the world to dull that pain. The procedure also seemed to last twice as long as the last one in May. The one I had in May was using gas and air, and I think it was the first time that I actually thought gas and air worked. It may have just been the placebo affect but I had somehow mastered it. I think I wasn&rsquo;t taking deep enough inhales before. It was a long time since I&rsquo;d felt this drunk and I was quite enjoying the experience! No such luck this time, I just had to grin and bear it.</p>
<p>With Leukaemia confirmed, the Haemotology team assessed the next steps. They don&rsquo;t like to arrange another transplant within 12 months, and anyway, the last one had failed, so they needed to look at other options. They explained to me that If this had happened a few years ago I would have been shit out of luck (not quite in those words). Luckily, there&rsquo;s now the option of CAR-T therapy.</p>
<h2 id="car-t-therapy">CAR-T Therapy</h2>
<p>Although fairly new as a treatment option, they had been seeing good results from chimeric antigen receptor - T cells (CAR-T) therapy. This is a type of immunotherapy where the T-Cells (blood cells that protect you from infection and disease) are extracted from the patient and genetically modified in a lab to find and kill cancer cells, before infusion back into the blood. In some cases, CAR-T has proved successful when all other treatments have failed.</p>
<p>In the UK. Leukaemia patients under 25 have been approved for CAR-T therapy. For those over 25, there&rsquo;s a national panel who gets to decide whether the treatment can go ahead. My doctor thought I would be a suitable candidate.</p>
<p>They quickly got me on the next panel for assessment and thankfully, I was approved.</p>
<p>I spent two weeks in hospital getting the Leukaemia under control using a combination of steroids, as well as oral and IV chemo. Once my white cells were back down to reasonable levels and other side-effects were under control, I was discharged. I came back on Thursday 8th August as a day patient for the CAR-T extraction (harvesting). Once extracted, the T-cells are sent off to a lab in Amsterdam and it is typically 4 weeks before they are returned for infusion. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m taking daily oral chemo to try and stop the Leukaemia from spreading.</p>
<p>The CAR-T extraction involved spending 5 hours on a machine called a Blood Cell Separator. A large line is inserted into one arm, the blood goes into the machine where it does its magic before being inserted back into my other arm. Since being admitted to hospital I&rsquo;ve also had another PICC line inserted to take blood and administer IV treatments but they can&rsquo;t use the PICC line for this.</p>
<p>After the extraction was complete. I then needed a blood transfusion. My haemoglobin levels that day were at dangerously low levels. No wonder I felt like I&rsquo;d been hit by a bus. I would need two bags of blood - both a 2.5 hr infusion. I was a long day.</p>
<h2 id="pain">Pain</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m now waiting for the T-cells to come back from Amsterdam. In the meantime, my days involve trying to keep on top of the pain and dealing with all the side effects of the meds they have me on. The main symptom of Leukaemia for me has been bone pain. I&rsquo;m taking pain relief every 4 hours but it&rsquo;s at night when it&rsquo;s the worst. I seem to be waking up at 1am every morning needing the toilet to find I&rsquo;m in agony. The pain goes from my back around in to my chest and is that intense that my body seizes up. I have to get Rach to help me out of bed.</p>
<p>The palliative care team saw me yesterday to talk about the pain and they&rsquo;ve modified what I&rsquo;m on. Let&rsquo;s see if it works. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m having much fun at the moment.</p>
<p>A lot of the meds that I&rsquo;m on make you drowsy. So just staying awake is a constant battle. If I keep busy I seem to be ok, but as soon as I stop and take a break, I&rsquo;m struggling to keep my eyes open.</p>
<p>The other problem is that those two weeks in hospital dramatically set back my fitness levels. It&rsquo;s as if the last few months were for nothing. I did a short 1 mile walk last week around a local lake and I thought I was going to have a heart attack at the end of it!</p>
<p>The doctor explained to me that, just like the stem cell transplant, I need to be in the best state of fitness to give the CAR-T a chance of success. The thing is, the pain at the moment means it&rsquo;s killing me just to get up stairs to my bedroom, never mind anything else.</p>
<p>The amount of oxy-codeine I&rsquo;m taking has also bunged me up again. Welcome back, constipation. It really is deja vu.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I am. It&rsquo;s now over a year since I was first diagnosed and things have basically gone back to January. We&rsquo;re hoping the CAR-T is successful. I haven&rsquo;t yet had the guts to ask what happens if it&rsquo;s not a success.</p>
<p>Before I go back in for CAR-T infusion I will need another bone marrow test, as well as a lumber puncture to deliver chemotherapy to protect the spine and brain. I&rsquo;m also having other various tests (ECG, lung function, etc), and I need 3 days of conditioning chemotherapy. Luckily this can be administered as a day patient.</p>
<p>As with the stem cell transplant, even if the CAR-T is a success there are still associated risks. The biggest and most likely risk is something called Cytokine release syndrome. The CAR-T stimulates the immune system to make large amounts of cytokines. This can result in symptoms such as fever, difficulty breathing, headaches, etc, and in the worst case may be require admittance to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). There&rsquo;s also a risk of neurological side effects, such as confusion, difficulty speaking etc. Usually these systems respond to steroids.</p>
<p>I will spend a minimum of 10 days as an in-patient following the CAR-T infusion (it was 5 weeks for the stem cell transplant), after which It will be months of monitoring and recovery. Similar to the stem cell transplant, my immune system will be depressed so I&rsquo;ll be at heightened risk of infections. Here we go again.</p>

		<a href="https://darylhaines.com/2024/05/27/day.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-27 17:32:17 &#43;0100">May 27, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week I reached another milestone - 100 days post-transplant. If all goes well, this is typically the time when I can come off the immuno-suppressing drugs, reduce other drugs, and start mixing with people again. I&rsquo;m happy to say that things have mostly gone well. Thanks to Nurse Ratched (sorry, I mean the loving care of my wife), I&rsquo;ve managed to avoid picking up any infections and I&rsquo;ve stayed out of hospital.</p>
<p>As fantastic as the care was in Australia, we&rsquo;ve now come to realise that the reason I probably kept picking up infections between chemo treatments was because we weren&rsquo;t following the neutropenic diet. In our defence, they told us about the importance of the diet in the first few days after getting diagnosed, when everything was a whirlwind, but never mentioned it again. By the time I was let out of hospital we had completely forgotten. It&rsquo;s not like I was picking up half-eaten kebabs off the pavement. We just forgot about the basics - the need to boil drinking water, avoid any kind of take-out food. Basically, avoid anything with live bacteria or anything where you can&rsquo;t be 100% certain that the food handling hygiene is top-notch.</p>
<p>The team at Sheffield, on the other hand, scared me to death about the risks. It worked. I was determined not to get re-admitted. Believe it or not, a Gregg&rsquo;s sausage roll is just not worth a week in hospital on IV antibiotics.</p>
<p>I reached the 100 days, and sure enough, my immune system is rebuilding and I&rsquo;m now off the neutropenic diet. I can drink beer again! Unfortunately, I can only seem to stomach one. Stomach ache and nausea is still ongoing so any hopes of a big day session in the pub are put on hold for now.</p>
<p>The other thing that is ongoing, and shows no sign yet of getting any better, is the neuropathy in my feet.</p>
<p>I asked the specialist when I could expect to get the feeling back in my feet. He said it could be weeks, months or never. It seems that predictions around neuropathy recovery are about as accurate as economists predicting the next recession. I&rsquo;m trying to get out walking as much as possible and I am slowly improving fitness, but I have serious stability issues - a moderate gust of wind can blow me over. People keep suggesting walking sticks and various other devices. I&rsquo;d rather just keep working on it. I need to work on my balance and I worry about becoming reliant on physical aids.</p>
<p>The next battle is fatigue. I&rsquo;m desperate for things to get back to normal. I want to get back to work. It&rsquo;s not like I need to work down a mine. I figured I&rsquo;d start working on my own projects again and once I approach being able to do 8 hrs a day at a computer I&rsquo;m ready for paid work. I&rsquo;m nowhere near it at the moment. My fit note from the Dr says that I&rsquo;m at high risk and may be unable to work for up to a year after transplant. I keep testing it. The problem is, just when I have a good day and think I&rsquo;m making progress, I feel completely wiped out the following day. My patience needs more patience (to misquote <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-karate-kid-2010/">Jackie Chan</a>).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also had the first of my long list of vaccines. They started me with the flu and covid jabs. I&rsquo;m a new-born baby as far as my immune system goes. I&rsquo;ve got a roadmap for the next 14 years of all the childhood vaccines I need again.</p>
<p>Lastly, I had the first post-transplant bone marrow biopsy. I should get the results in the next week. They&rsquo;re looking for two things: 1) that there&rsquo;s no sign of Leukaemia returning, and 2) chimerism analysis - the mix of my cells vs donor cells. I should be close to 100% donor cells by now. Wish me luck!</p>

			 <p>I’ve just completed four weeks in isolation. My <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2024/02/08/transplant-day-and.html">last update</a> was the day before transplant day after undergoing a week of conditioning chemo.</p>
<h2 id="transplant-day">Transplant Day</h2>
<p>I was surprisingly calm the morning of transplant day. I put on my Unwind playlist and listened to some calming music. Rach, Lauren and my parents arrived to be with me for the transplant. It broke the 2 visitors per day rule but nobody batted an eyelid as this was not a normal day.</p>
<p>The nurse from the transplant team arrived in the afternoon and delivered the special package. The donor had done really well and delivered easily more blood than they needed.</p>
<p>The bag of blood with the new stem cells was hung up and connected to my central line. It was funny looking. I’ve had plenty of blood transfusions but they were always a bag of deep red blood as you would expect. This bag was murky and orange. The main thing was that it contained 500 million stem cells.</p>
<p>The infusion took place over a couple of hours and the transplant nurse stayed with me to monitor it for the duration. On one hand it was a simple blood transfusion. On the other hand It was a hugely emotional experience and I was under no misapprehension as to the significance of it. Pretty quickly the grafting process would start and my body would be building a new immune system - using someone else&rsquo;s stem cells. My blood DNA would change. This was a huge milestone and would hopefully seriously reduce the risk of Leukaemia returning, or, my body could fight it and it could be the beginning of serious complications due to host vs graft disease.</p>
<h2 id="post-transplant">Post-Transplant</h2>
<p>I was told to expect to spend 4-6 weeks in hospital. My goal was for it to be 4 weeks and not a day longer. Of course, much of this is out of your hands. However, there are things you can do to reduce the chances of it being longer. I was determined to do everything right. I would take all the meds, get the timing right for anti-sickness and pain relief, keep on top of the mouthwashes to reduces the severity of mucusitus, keep clean and try not to stay in bed all day, etc, etc.</p>
<p>I’m really not sure if any of this made a difference. I’ve had mucusitus with every chemo cycle and the same happened this time. I think I may have delayed it a few days but sure enough, about a week and a half after finishing chemo it quickly set in with a vengeance. I couldn’t swallow anything. They had to switch my tablets to IV meds and I was on a fluid diet for a week. I also got all the usual chemo side effects - vomiting, fatigue, diarrhoea, etc. Strangely enough, I kind of took this all in my stride. I’ve been dealing with this shit since July so it was nothing new.</p>
<p>What did give me strength was the daily visits from the consultants who told me I was smashing it. At one point, the consultant told me that at this stage in the cycle most of his patients were crying under a blanket wearing a nappy!</p>
<p>Inevitably all my hair has dropped out again. It happened about a week later than is usually the case so I thought I’d got away with it this time. Nope. It was gone in no time.</p>
<p>I got to week 4 and I became obsessed with my daily blood results. To get out of there my neutrophils count had to be above 1 and I needed to be off IV for any other issues that I was dealing with. I had a few - acute kidney disease because I wasn’t getting enough fluid, low potassium, magnesium, and other things that would pop up.</p>
<p>In week 4 they commenced with G-CSF injections to stimulate the production of white blood cells. The side effect of this, which I’ve dealt with before, is severe bone pain. I usually only get it the first couple of nights but this time it lasted 4 days. The second night was the worst, I just couldn’t get the pain under control. I had a Fentanyl patch on my back and thy were giving me oxy-codone but it wasn’t enough. I was pacing around my room in agony. Eventually they doubled the dose of painkillers and this did the trick. The next night I made sure I got the painkillers in early in advance of the severe pain - it always seemed to kick in around 11pm.</p>
<p>The first results came in - Neutraphils at 0.15. It was a start, but it was only 5 days before my goal of getting out of there after exactly 4 weeks. The next day - 0.28. Then the following day - 0.57. Then - 1.1. I had made it. I had also managed to get all the IV stuff switched back to oral tablets. With one day to go, barring some last minute problems, I was on track to be released.</p>
<h2 id="discharge-day">Discharge Day</h2>
<p>I was out of there, but, for anyone who has experienced stays in hospital you will know that discharge day is the longest day of the hospital stay. The problem is always pharmacy. It was the same in Australia. They told me to expect to not be discharged until about 6pm. 6pm came and went. I have no idea what happened but I didn’t get discharged until 1am. It was crazy. My wife was getting increasingly agitated. The nurses on the ward were constantly apologetic but it was completely out of their control. I have no idea what the problem was but it seems to me that pharmacy is completely dysfunctional. Is it lack of staff? Process problems? Who knows. It did take the shine off exit day. By the time we got home in the middle of the night I was exhausted.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter now. Home sweet home.</p>
<p>I say home sweet home but in truth it’s probably going to be a while before this seems like home. I only had a few days in our new house before hospital admission, so everything is really new. I’m sure it won’t take long. It is nice to sleep in my own bed and not get woken in the night multiple times for obs.</p>
<p>As I explained in my previous post, now is the time for home isolation. I have no immune system so it’s a case of being really, really careful to avoid picking up anything that will lead to me being hospitalised again. Everyone has told me that as careful as I can be it’s pretty much inevitable that I will end up back in. Nearly everyone who goes through this does - multiple times.</p>
<p>I’m taking no chances though. If I have any visitors they get temperature checked at the door and need to wear a mask. They know not to visit if there’s any signs of sickness. If I go out it’s for fresh air only - a walk in open spaces. I won’t be going in any shops or restaurants, even with a mask, until I’m well on the road to recovery.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I started this blog in 2006. I used to blog quite a lot, but then Facebook, Twitter, etc took over the world and I got swept up in social media like most people.</p>
<p>I then got disillusioned. First with Facebook after all the drip, drip, drip of revelations about privacy breaches, election interference, fake news, user tracking, etc.</p>
<p>Then my Twitter feed stopped becoming useful as it got filled with political posts and just turned nasty. Ironically, as nuts as Elon Must has become (especially since buying Twitter and rebranding it to X), the feed is now actually better as many of the loud voices who spouted politics all the time left Twitter in protest against Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I used to regularly post photos on Instagram. But of course, Instagram is owned by Meta (Facebook) and the lack of trust made me reluctant to keep posting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve moved my blog a number of times over the years. I&rsquo;ve self-hosted on servers and used Wordpress. I was on Squarespace for a while. At one time I was on an Amazon Web Services instance running Wordpress. Then finally I moved to Wordpress.com - basically because it&rsquo;s cheap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known about <a href="Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> for a while and lately it seemed the perfect platform for what I need. Especially after they changed to allow posts above 300 characters. Micro.blog was originally set up as an alternative to Twitter. It&rsquo;s open source, and purposefully doesn&rsquo;t have things like likes or follower counts. The idea is to just post without worrying about popularity. It&rsquo;s an active community that is part of the Fediverse, similar to Mastodon.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t want to post long blog posts, especially in my current situation where fatigue is a real problem. Sometimes I just want to post short thoughts, or links to something I find interesting, just like I used to do on Twitter. With Micro.blog I&rsquo;ve got the option to post short posts or long blog posts and no one is going to monetise my posts or fill my feed with ads.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the plan. If it&rsquo;s a long blog post I&rsquo;ll cross post it to Twitter and Facebook. Short posts will just be on Micro.blog. If you want to see all my posts, long and short, you can <a href="https://darylhaines.com/subscribe/">Subscribe to my feed by email or RSS</a>. I also cross-post to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/darylhai.bsky.social">BlueSky</a>. BlueSky looks interesting but it&rsquo;s only just opened up to the general public and there&rsquo;s not really that many people on there yet that I want to follow. This is the problem with social media - it&rsquo;s reliant on the network effect. You are only going to use it if your friends or people you find interesting use it.</p>

			 <p>Here we go. Tomorrow is the big day. This week has been about undergoing conditioning chemo to prepare my body for the transplant.</p>
<p>Most people hear the word transplant and think it involves surgery. In the case of blood cancers it&rsquo;s simply a blood transfusion. I say &lsquo;simply&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s not like the many blood transfusions I&rsquo;ve had since being diagnosed, this one has profound implications.</p>
<h2 id="conditioning-chemo">Conditioning Chemo</h2>
<p>This week I&rsquo;ve been isolated in a hospital room undergoing chemotherapy that has the sole goal of killing my bone marrow. The bone marrow produces the stem cells which produces the blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets). In the case of Leukaemia it&rsquo;s the white blood cells that are the problem.</p>
<p>It has been very similar to all the chemo I&rsquo;ve been through previously. If all goes to plan, this could be my final day and I&rsquo;ll never need it again.</p>
<p>It was going pretty well until yesterday. I had an allergic reaction to the day 6 chemo. It&rsquo;s fairly common and they gave me pre-meds to try and prevent the reaction. I got close to the end of the 4-hour infusion and within seconds the reaction started (I think the pre-meds had worn off) - rash and swelling in my face, sickness and diarrhoea, fever. It&rsquo;s happened before and I wasn&rsquo;t too worried. It took them sometime to get it under control but I&rsquo;m now ok for the final chemo today.</p>
<p>I also had an x-ray in my left foot. About 3 weeks ago I noticed my left foot had swollen up and become incredibly tender. This week the consultant looked at it and thought it may be gout brought on by all the meds. He got a rheumatologist to look at it, who concurred, but booked me in for an x-ray anyway just to check for other things. Bizarrely, the x-ray revealed a lump of metal in my big toe. How long it’s been there or how it even got there without me noticing is a mystery. It could be entirely unrelated and the swelling could still be gout. Either way, it’s too dangerous to cut my toe open now. The metal will have to stay there for the time being. I’m on meds for gout anyway as part of the conditioning treatment. The steroids will hopefully deal with the swelling.</p>
<p>Today requires close planning and timing. I have to reach a certain hydration level before they give me the IV chemo and there has to be 24 hours between chemo and the transplant.</p>
<p>My hair had started to grow back during the maintenance chemo that I&rsquo;ve had in the last 6 weeks. I&rsquo;ve been told to expect to lose it all again - probably around the middle of next week.</p>
<h2 id="transplant-day">Transplant Day</h2>
<p>Transplant day, also known as zero day or re-birth day is when the fun begins. I know what to expect with chemo and how to deal with it. The transplant, however, is a big mystery. No one can say for certain how my body will react.</p>
<p>Sometime this week the donor has had the procedure to donate his bone marrow. I&rsquo;m not allowed to know who the donor is, and my hospital aren&rsquo;t allowed to know either. Once delivered, they have 72 hours to get it into me. Unfortunately, the survival chance is a bit lower for an unrelated matched donor than a sibling. Them&rsquo;s the breaks.</p>
<p>The fact that a healthy donor is volunteering to have a bone marrow biopsy for a complete stranger is amazing to me. It&rsquo;s one thing giving blood or signing consent to give up your organs when you die, this is another thing entirely. The donor could save my life. I hope one day I can properly offer my thanks.</p>
<p>Unlike a normal blood transfusion which is managed by the nurses, this one is all managed by the transplant team. The team will come into my room, set up the infusion into my central line (Hickman line) and slowly deliver the stem cells over a period of about 2 hours. My family will be here in the room. The isolation room is due to the lack of an immune system. All staff and visitors have to enter an ante-room, get into a gown, gloves and face mask before entering my room. Anyone who has visited Covid patients in hospital will be very familiar with this.</p>
<p>Once delivered, the scary stuff could start pretty quickly - within minutes. The main risk is graft versus host disease (GvHD). The transplanted cells can start to attack the other cells in my body. I&rsquo;ve been told the body could reactivate anything I&rsquo;ve had in the past - chicken pox, mumps, etc. Vaccination history is no longer a factor. It could also go after my organs, which is a little more scary.</p>
<p>I can expect to stay another 3-5 weeks in hospital in isolation and under close observation. After this time, they should have a good idea whether the transplant has been a success.</p>
<p>One of the things that I find amazing and never really thought about is that my DNA is going to change. DNA is in the blood. I&rsquo;ll have a mix of my own DNA and the donor&rsquo;s DNA.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>From today, they will give me drugs to continue to suppress my immune system for a few months. This is a very dangerous time. I have to be really careful about who and what I come into contact with as a simple cold can spell disaster.</p>
<p>I also have to be on a neutropenic diet. Pregnant women are familiar with the basic stuff - no soft cheeses, no shell fish, etc. This goes a bit further. I must have boiled water, no salads or shop-bought sandwiches, only fruit with a peel, no takeaways or any kind of food that could have been sat around for a while (like Greggs), etc, etc. There&rsquo;s a large list of what I can and can&rsquo;t have. It&rsquo;s going to be a pain in this ass for Rach. She&rsquo;s an angel but I do worry about the toll it&rsquo;s going to take on her as my carer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to return to hospital twice a week during the first year for blood tests. It could also be another year before I can work again. Best case scenario is that I may be able to pick up a computer and do a bit of online work after 3 months but it&rsquo;s doubtful I could get insurance for a contract or get a full-time job during this time.</p>
<p>After a year I have to have all my childhood vaccinations and COVID jabs again. I&rsquo;ll have a new immune system. I could have completely new allergies.</p>
<p>For the rest of my life I need to carry a transplant card with me indicating that I have irradiated blood, just in case something happens and I need a blood transfusion.</p>
<p>If all goes well this is the beginning of the end. Cancer takes over your life. I want to think, talk and write about something else. I even miss work.</p>
<p>The adventure begins tomorrow!</p>

			 <p>I once spent some time with Prince Charles (as he was then) and we had a good chat over a beer or two. Not on my own of course. He came onboard one of the ships I was on and a bunch of us got invited to meet him. I struggle to recall the year or even which ship it was. Much of it is a blur. I do recall him being genuinely funny and easy to talk to. I was probably too young and stupid to ask him any insightful questions.</p>
<p>Most people who have served have no doubt got similar stories. The senior royals have a close connection with all 3 services.</p>
<p>I met him again when he came onboard HMS Invincible for a medal ceremony.  Those of us who had took part in the peacekeeping missions for the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts received some bling. I don’t have much memorabilia from my time in the navy but at least I can say it was the future king who handed me a medal.</p>
<p>Cancer sucks. I hope he learns to deal with it the same way I have - distraction.</p>
<p>Keep busy when you can. Otherwise, sit back and watch some sedate TV. Nothing loud. Nothing with ads (it’s amazing how many cancer-related ads there are in the UK), and definitely nothing to do with hospitals. Try meditation. Try whatever it takes to switch the brain to something else. Pain is ultimately a brain response. After many procedures and needles in the last 6 months I’ve realised that it hurts less when engaged and chatting. Of course, distraction only goes so far. Sometimes it’s just shit whatever you do.</p>
<p>I hope he has a speedy recovery.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m back in the UK and the bone marrow transplant is happening.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://darylhaines.com/2023/09/06/luekemia.html">last post</a> was about 2 months into chemo. Since then, it has continued to be a roller coaster. I ended up having 6 cycles of chemo and spent 5 months in hospital (so far). We made the flights that we originally booked and I&rsquo;m now under the care of the transplant team at Sheffield Hallamshire hospital.</p>
<h2 id="chemo-and-infections">Chemo and Infections</h2>
<p>Chemotherapy has been tough. Many of the side effects repeated with each cycle but I did get better at managing them. The protocol for my treatment required two different courses of treatment - A and B. This was repeated 3 times - hence the 6 cycles. A and B had different drugs and I&rsquo;m still trying to make my mind up which was worse. I had a few bad reactions to some of them so they were tweaked as we went along. Each cycle followed a familiar pattern over 3 weeks - a few days of IV and oral chemo until I was neutropenic (no immune system), a few days of recovery, and then more days of chemo.</p>
<p>After a few weeks, being in hospital was driving me nuts. I could look out of the window and see our apartment across the road. The doctor could tell it was having an impact on my mental health so had to weigh up the risk of letting me out for a break against the risk of me staying in and turning into a mental wreck. The first two cycles of chemo were back to back. After that, they were happy for me to go home for a 1 week break between cycles. It was never enough. I would be at home in recovery but still having all the side effects - fatigue, nausea and vomiting, etc. I would get to day 6 of being at home and just starting to feel a little better when it was time to go back in again.</p>
<p>After the first couple of cycles they also gave me a pass to go home mid-cycle for the recovery days with a warning that if I started to get feverish I would need to come back in straight away because even a cold could kill me. They had seen it all before and they were absolutely right. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I would go across the road to my apartment, not leave it, and nearly every time I would pick up an infection. After a few months this was devastating. I&rsquo;d be desperate to get out of hospital (just to get some sleep, if nothing else), and sometimes within hours I would feel myself getting a fever. Rach would take my temperature and as soon as it got close to 38 degrees I&rsquo;d be back in hospital again. I stupidly argued with her - trying to come up with any rationale why it&rsquo;s not really a fever and we should wait a little longer. She rightly was having none of it. So I&rsquo;d go back in and immediately get put on a course of antibiotics. This often then delayed my discharge at the end of the cycle.</p>
<h2 id="weight-losshair-loss-etc">Weight loss,Hair Loss, .etc</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer overweight. I&rsquo;m back in 32 inch trousers for the first time in many years and even they were falling off me when I got discharged after the 6th cycle. I know some people on chemo put on weight (mainly due to the steroids), but in my case I was only on steroids for a few days at the beginning of each cycle. The weight loss has been due to a combination of loss of appetite, nausea and mucusitus (which happened every cycle).</p>
<p>After the 6 cycles of chemo I got put onto maintenance chemo for the trip back to the UK and while waiting for the bone marrow transplant. This is essentially one tablet a day of oral chemo (Dasatanib) alongside the other meds I need to protect my organs and deal with the side effects. The reduced dose has meant my hair has started to grow back, my appetite has returned and even my tastebuds are coming back. It will no doubt all go again with the high dose chemo required in preparation for the transplant.</p>
<h2 id="wheelchair">Wheelchair</h2>
<p>For the first couple of cycles I was highly motivated to work with the physio and keep up exercise to try and stop muscle loss. However, as the chemo went on and on, the side effects persisted and the fatigue kicked my butt. I just got weaker and weaker. I only really noticed how weak I was becoming when I got to go home. Just walking across the road and going up a few steps became a struggle.</p>
<p>I was dead set against using a wheelchair but Rach convinced me to use one for Lauren&rsquo;s graduation. I&rsquo;m glad I listened to her. I realised how bad things had become when I got out of the wheelchair to get into the shuttle bus to go over to the other side of the campus. It was only a couple of steps up but my legs completely collapsed from underneath me. I couldn&rsquo;t get up. It was ridiculous.</p>
<p>That was on the 8th December. Flights to the UK were booked for the 18th December and there was no time left to recover enough fitness to have a trip home without help. We booked wheelchair assistance at the airports (and did I learn a few things about airport security!). I’ll talk more about the trip back in another post.</p>
<h2 id="laurens-graduation">Lauren&rsquo;s Graduation</h2>
<p>After 5 years of university, our daughter Lauren graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Speech Pathology with honours degree. She originally did a year of Psychology at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) before deciding to change direction to speech pathology. Hence the 5 years. It was the proudest day of my life. I was a physical and emotional wreck. Right up until the day itself I didn&rsquo;t know if I would make the graduation. I never know from one day to the next how my health will be. The whole reason we stayed in Australia and I had 6 cycles of chemo (instead of the planned 4) was so that I wouldn&rsquo;t miss her graduation. I&rsquo;m so grateful to my doctor that he made everything work so I wouldn&rsquo;t miss it.</p>
<p>Lauren is now a qualified speech pathologist and is waiting for her registration to transfer to the UK so she can take up a role as a speech therapist. It&rsquo;s going to take a few months. She has put her original plans for backpacking around Europe on hold for a while, pending what happens with my transplant.</p>
<h2 id="transplant-consent">Transplant Consent</h2>
<p>On the 2nd January, I had my consultation in Sheffield with Dr Morley who heads the transplant team.</p>
<p>I still have PTSD from that conversation. I had been given lots of information about the transplant while I was in Australia but I largely ignored it. My thinking was ignorance is bliss and I would deal with it when the time came. Let me at least enjoy a Christmas back in the UK with family and friends. Also, I honestly thought I had been through the worst.</p>
<p>Well, this was the time I needed to know the facts, and the facts are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The transplant won’t cure Leukaemia but is the best tool they have to reduce the likelihood of relapse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I don’t have the transplant the chance of relapse is almost certain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transplant is high risk. If I do have the transplant there’s a 1 in 5 chance that I’ll die within 12 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I survive the first 12 months I could develop lots of long term health problems - and some people wish they had never had the transplant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As he was telling me this I felt the emotion building up and by the time he got to the 1 in 5 stat I broke down. I apologised but he said that was a completely normal and appropriate response to learning that news.</p>
<p>I do risk assessments for a living. I know that 1 in 5 is not good, but what choice do I have? If I  don&rsquo;t have the transplant I’ll be scared every day that the cancer will come back. This is not something you can mess about with. Just from a bit of back pain I was 3 weeks away from death.</p>
<p>I signed the consent form.</p>
<h2 id="here-we-go">Here We Go</h2>
<p>Today I had the Hickman line inserted. This goes into the heart and 2 ports are now sticking out my chest. I can’t say it was a nice experience. I think I preferred the PICC line. Either way, a usb-c port would have been handy!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll get admitted for a week of high dose chemo before the transplant. I should expect to stay 3-6 weeks in hospital and it will be many more months before I can think about working. Money is quickly running out. More on that later.</p>

<p>On Sunday I went on a photo tour of the Gold Coast which I booked with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Deluxe Coastal Photo Tours<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. When I started to plan our upcoming trip back to Europe I set myself a number of objectives to make the most out of the trip, one of which was to learn photography.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This will be our first trip back since emigrating in 2007 and it&rsquo;s set to be epic. Besides time in our home towns visting family and friends, our itinerary includes London, Bath, Oxford and the Cotswolds in the UK; Venice; Grindelwald in the Swiss Alps; and Paris. We also have stopovers on Sentosa Island, Singapore on the way out, and Hong Kong on the way back. With that itinerary in mind I&rsquo;ve been determined to take my Canon DSLR off automatic settings and learn what I need to in order to capture the best memories from the trip.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
